The file lecture_17.lscm contains the code for an interpreter for a
Scheme-like language, in a literate-Scheme convention, which means that UMASS
Scheme can compile it directly (if verbosely).

You are to add the let construct to this. Here is an example to try:


(example
    '(eval_env!
        '(let ((x (+ 3 4))  (y (+ 6 7)))  (+ x y))
        the-global-environment
        )
    20)

Your code ____must work with an arbitrary number of variables in the let-binding.

____Hint  the above computation is exactly equivalent to:

(eval_env!
    '((lambda (x y) (+ x y)) (+ 3 4) (+ 6 7))
    the-global-environment
    )


Note that the ".lscm"  file extension stands for  ________literate ______Scheme. That is  to
say, the compiler  only interprets  as Scheme  expressions anything  beginning
with a left  parenthesis at  the start  of a  line of  text. You  may find  it
convenient to copy section 3 of the  Lecture 16 into your hwk9.lscm file,  and
then develop your own code in a 'temp.scm' file (or whatever you want to  call
it). Some aspects  of the  development environment are  different for  '.lscm'
files, and this will avoid confusion. At the end you can paste your code  into
the hwk9.lscm for submission.
