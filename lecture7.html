<p>
One important thing that computers do is recognise whether a  sequence
of objects forms a valid statement in a <em>language</em>. For example,

<pre>
     x := x + 1
</pre>

<p>
is a Pascal statement, while

<pre>
     the cat eats the canary.
</pre>


<p>
is a  statement of  the English  language: a Pascal compiler <em>must</em>
be able to recognise that the first statement is legal Pascal, while a
program aiming to provide an intelligent natural-language interface to
users should be able to recognise that the second statement is a sentence
of English.

<p>
A <em>parser</em> is a Scheme  function which recognises a  <em>phrase</em>
in a language, that is to say in the case of English, some well-formed part
of a sentence. For example, we regard  <tt>"the
cat"</tt> as a phrase of  the
English language. Why do we focus on recognising <em> phrases</em>? Because
we can only build a  parser for something as  complicated as a sentence  by
building parsers for small parts of a language first.

We shall see in this  lecture how we can  systematically build up a  parser
for a  given language  by  building up  parsers  to recognise  ever  larger
phrases of  the language.  For example,  if we  are creating  a parser  for
English,  we  will   create  parsers  to   recognise  <em>nouns</em>,   and
<em>determiners</em> (the words "a" and "the") and integrate these  parsers
into one for recognising <em>noun-phrases</em>; we then build a parser for
sentences out of noun- and verb- phrase parsers.

<p> Formally, languages are defined by <em>grammars</em>. Commonly grammars
are written  using <em>productions</em>,  which  specify how  a  high-level
concept, such as <em>sentence</em> can be expressed or rewritten in
terms of lower-level concepts such as  phrases, which in  turn are
expressed  in terms of  still lower level concepts such as  words.

For example, the production


<pre>
    <b>sentence</b>  -> <b>noun_phrase</b> <b>verb_phrase</b>
</pre>

says that a sentence is a noun-phrase followed by a verb-phrase. In Scheme
terms, this is saying that the list of words which constitutes a sentence
for example:

<pre>
    '(the cat eats the canary)
</pre>

can be computed by appending the list of words which constitutes a
noun-phrase  <tt>the cat</tt> to the list of words that constitute a
verb-phrase <tt>eats the canary</tt>.

<pre>
    (append '(the cat) '(eats the canary))
</pre>


We speak of <em>terminal  symbols</em>
as being those entities in the grammar which cannot be rewritten, and which
are thus words (or "tokens", or "lexemes") of the language.  Those entities
in the grammar which  can
be rewritten are  called "non-terminal  symbols". So, in writing a grammar,
it is necessary to distinguish between terminal and non-terminal symbols.

We shall use  the notation that  we have already  been using informally  to
descibe Scheme,  in  which  non-terminals  are  written  using  <b>bold</b>
typewriter characters, while  terminals are written  using plain  tyewriter
characters.


A grammar for a small subset of English might be written as

<pre>
    <b>sentence</b>    -> <b>noun_phrase</b> <b>verb_phrase</b>

    <b>noun_phrase</b> -> <b>determiner</b> <b>noun</b>

    <b>determiner</b>  -> the
    <b>determiner</b>  -> a

    <b>noun</b>        -> cat
    <b>noun</b>        -> dog
    <b>noun</b>        -> canary

    <b>verb_phrase</b> -> <b>verb</b> <b>noun_phrase</b>
    <b>verb</b>        -> eats
    <b>verb</b>        -> likes
</pre>

<p>
For convenience, the vertical bar can be used to indicate alternative
Right Hand Sides


<pre>
    <b>verb</b>   -> eats | likes
</pre>


<TABLE BORDER=2>
<TR>
<TD>
The earliest convention  for writing productions used by computer
scientists is  Backus-Naur  Form (BNF),  in  which  non-terminal
symbols are enclosed in angle brackets. For example

<pre>
    &lt;sentence> -> &lt;noun_phrase> &lt;verb_phrase>
    &lt;determiner> -> the

</pre>

</TD>
</TR>
<TR> <TD>
Another convention that is used is to quote terminal symbols, thus:
<pre>
    sentence -> noun_phrase verb_phrase
    determiner -> "the"
</pre>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>



<h2><A name = "parsing">Parsing a Sentence in a Language</a></h2>


<p>
We have said  above that a  <em>parser</em> is a  function for  recognising
that a particular sequence  of terminal symbols is  a legal statement  in a
language. As well as performing the recognition, practical applications  of
parsers usually require that some  kind of <em>parse-tree</em> is  produced
to represent  the  logical  structure  of  the  statement.  For  example, a
compiler needs a parse-tree in order  to generate code. A natural  language
query system requires a parse tree in order to "understand" a question  put
to it and to generate an answer.

<p>
In computer science  we normally  call the  terminal symbols
fed  to a  parser "tokens" - they are the equivalent of <em>words</em> in
the English language.

<p>
If we are writing  a parser in Scheme,  the natural thing to  do is to  use
Scheme lists to represent parse-trees. So, a Pascal parser might parse:

<pre>
    '(x + 2 * y)
</pre>

<p>
as the Scheme structure

<pre>
    '(+ x (* 2 y))
</pre>

<p>
We might think of a parser as being  a function that took a list of  tokens
and returned a parse-tree. However that raises two problems - the first  is
relatively trivial - we have to find some way of signalling that a list  of
tokens is not in fact  a sentence of the language  - well, we could  return
<tt>#f</tt> (if we were sure that <tt>#f</tt> couldn't be mistaken  for
an actual parse-tree).

<p>
The second problem  is more serious  - it's to  do with what  might be  called
compositionality. It's obviously hopeless  to try to  write one huge  function
which will perform a parse of a complex language. So, we are going to have  to
build a parser out of smaller functions that we write. What sort of functions?
Well, the obvious choice is to build big parsers out of smaller ones.



We can use the  <em>language definition</em> as a guide to doing this.

<pre>
    <b>sentence</b>  -> <b>noun_phrase</b> <b>verb_phrase</b>
</pre>

<p>
If we want a parser for a <b>sentence</b>, presumably it makes sense to try
to build it out  of a parser for  the grammatical class  <b>noun_phrase</b>
and of  a  parser  for the  class  verb_phrase.  So, suppose  we  want  our
<b>sentence</b>-parser to parse this sentence:

<pre>
    (the cat eats the canary)
</pre>

<p>
What text are the <b>noun_phrase</b>  parser and the   verb_phrase parser going to
have to work on?  Clearly the <b>noun_phrase</b>-parser is going to work on the
whole list:

<pre>
    (the cat eats the canary)
</pre>

<p>
recognising <tt>(the cat)</tt> as being a <b>noun_phrase</b>. But the
<b>verb_phrase</b>-parser is
going to have to work on <tt>(eats
the  canary)</tt>. So we have to provide some  way
of giving it its  correct argument. If  we simply gave it  the
<tt>cddr</tt>
of  the
original list this  would be making  the assumption that  each noun  phrase
consists of exactly  two tokens, which  is actually true  for our  existing
grammar, but would build in  an assumption that could  be very wrong if  we
wanted to extend it, perhaps by allowing an obtional adjectives in front of
the noun, as in <tt>(the
furry cat  eats the canary)</tt>. And indeed, it would  be a
very bad mistake when creating parsers to assume that any given grammatical
class had a fixed length.

<p>
Much better is to require a parser  to return as its result a record  which
contains the <em>part of the original list of tokens which remains
unparsed</em>.
That way we  can assemble
the  two parsers  for noun phrases  and verb  phrases
together (or any other two). We can  think of the first parser as  "eating"
tokens until it  is satisfied,  when what remains  is given  to the  second
parser.

<p>Note that it is adequate if we require that a parser recognise that the
list of tokens that it is given as an argument <em>begin</em> with a
sequence of tokens drawn from the language to be recognised. Thus a parser
for English would not accept <tt>'(gobbledegook the cat eats the
canary)</tt>.


<HR>
<a name = "cons_parse"></a>
<a name = "tree_parse"></a>
<a name = "rest_parse"></a>
<h4> Making records to represent the result of parsing</h4>

<p>
So we need records to store our parses in. Each record has two  components,
the <tt>tree_parse</tt>  component  is  a  representation of  what  the  parser  has
actually found,  and  the  <tt>rest_parse</tt>  component  is  the  list  of  tokens
remaining unparsed.


<p>
If we are using  UMASS Scheme we  can define a record  class for parses  as
follows:

<pre>
(define class_parse (record-class 'parse '(full full)))

(define cons_parse   (car class_parse))
(define sel_parse    (caddr class_parse))
(define tree_parse   (car sel_parse))
(define rest_parse   (cadr sel_parse))
</pre>

Here the <a href = "lecture6.html#record-class">
record-class</a> function creates a class of <em>opaque</em>
records which can only be created by a <em>constructor</em> function, and
only be accessed by <em>selector</em> functions. The call of
<tt>record-class</tt> produces a <em>list</em>, <tt>class_parse</tt>
containing the functions necessary to create and access records.




<p>
Now, a parser can signal failure by returning <tt>#f</tt>
without risk of confusion, since if it succeeds it will always return one
of these parse-records.


<p>
Thus we can regard a parser as a function which takes as argument a list of
tokens and returns as result

<UL>
<LI>
    EITHER a parse whose <tt>tree_parse</tt> is a <em>parse-tree</em>
    of a recognised phrase and whose <tt>rest_parse</tt> is the remainder
    of the list when the phrase is "bitten off".
<LI>
    OR <tt>#f</tt>,
to indicate that the argument-list does not begin with the
            required phrase.
</UL>

<p>
For example, we might  write a parser which  recognised expressions in  the
Pascal language.  In this  case we  could return  a Scheme  expression  (in
internal form) which represented the Pascal. Thus the Pascal expression
<tt> x+2*y </tt> would be represented by the Scheme

<pre>
    (+ x (* 2 y))
</pre>

<p>
Thus suppose we have a parser for Pascal called <tt>parse_pascal</tt>, and
we apply it to a list of Pascal tokens


<pre>
    (define p
        (parse_pascal '(x + 2 * y ; z := 4;))
        )
</pre>

<p>
then the Scheme variable <tt>p</tt>  will have the value which prints as:

<pre>
        &lt;parse (begin (+ x (* 2 y)) (:= z 4)) '()>
</pre>

<p>
if we choose an obvious way to represent Pascal as Scheme.

<a name = "parse_determiner"> </a>
<h4> <tt>parse_determiner</tt> recognises if a sequence of words begins
with a determiner.</h4>

<p>
To make a parser for the  whole English language is <em>hard</em>- even  to
make a parser  for a programming  language is quite  hard. However, let  us
make a start at a parser for some English noun phrases,

<pre>
    <b>noun_phrase</b> ->  <b>determiner</b> <b>noun</b>
    <b>determiner</b>   -> the
    <b>determiner</b>   -> a
</pre>

<p>
That is to  say, a <b>determiner</b>  is the  word "a" or  "the". So  let's
write the parser for a determiner. The  function takes a list of tokens  as
argument. If (1) the list of  tokens begins with the symbol <tt>'a</tt>  or
with the symbol <tt>'the</tt>, then we do indeed have a determiner, so  (2)
we create a parse-record,  consisting of the actual  symbol found (3),  and
the unparsed  list (4).  Otherwise (5)  we return  <tt>#f</tt> to  indicate
failure.

<pre>


(define parse_determiner
    (lambda (list_of_tokens)
        (cond
            ((null? list_of_tokens) #f)
            ((member? (car list_of_tokens) '(a the)) ; (1) determiner?
             (cons_parse                             ; (2) yes!, make parse
                 (car list_of_tokens)                ; (3) tree
                 (cdr list_of_tokens)))              ; (4) unparsed list
             (else   #f )                            ; (5) no. fail
            )   ; end cond
        )       ; end lambda
    )           ; end definition

</pre>

<p>
We will need the definition of <tt>member?</tt> from Lecture 5:

<pre>
(define (member? x list)
     (if (null? list) #f
         (if (equal? x (car list)) #t
              (member? x (cdr list)))))
</pre>

<p>
We can now try this out. The call

<pre>
    (parse_determiner '(the cat eats the canary))
</pre>

<p>
returns the parse-record:

<pre>
    &lt;parse the (cat eats the canary)>
</pre>

<p>
So, here the <tt>tree_parse</tt> component of the <tt>parse</tt> record is
the symbol <tt> 'the </tt> (which is a <em>very simple</em> tree...),
while the <tt>rest_parse</tt>
component is <tt>'(eats the canary)</tt>, that is the original list with
the determiner removed.



<p>
While if there is no determiner:

<pre>
    (parse_determiner '(eats the canary))
</pre>

<p>
we get

<pre>
    #f
</pre>

<p>
Note that there  is a bug  in this function,  we have not  allowed for  the
possibility that the list of tokens might be empty. We'll mend this later.


<a name = "parse_noun"> </a>
<h4> <tt>parse_noun</tt> recognises if a sequence of words begins
with a noun.</h4>

<p>
Likewise we could define a <b>noun</b> as a member of a list of words known
to be nouns. Now there  are tens if not hundreds  of thousands of nouns  in
the English language, so this would be  a long list (and expensive to  look
through), but we can restrict our vocabulary.

<pre>
(define noun '(cat dog child woman man bone cabbage canary))


(define parse_noun
    (lambda (list_of_tokens)
        (cond
            ((null? list_of_tokens) #f)
            ((member? (car list_of_tokens) noun)     ; (1) noun?
             (cons_parse                             ; (2) yes!, make parse
                 (car list_of_tokens)                ; (3) tree
                 (cdr list_of_tokens)))              ; (4) unparsed list
             (else   #f )                            ; (5) no. fail
            )   ; end cond
        )       ; end lambda
    )           ; end definition



</pre>


<p> Now, can we write a parser  for a <b>noun_phrase</b>? We want to  write
this in a  way which makes  use of  our two existing  parsers, rather  than
trying to write a function  that sees if the <tt>list_of_tokens</tt>  has a
determiner as a first word and a noun as second. This is NOT what we should
do:


<pre>
(define parse_noun_phrase
    (lambda (list_of_tokens)         ; DONT DO THIS
        (if (and
                (member? (car list_of_tokens) '(a the))
                (member? (cadr list_of_tokens) noun)
                )
            (cons_parse
                (list 'noun_phrase   (car list_of_tokens)
                    (cadr list_of_tokens))
                (cddr list_of_tokens)
                )
            #f)
        ))
</pre>

<p>
Why is  writing  the  above function  not  a  good way  to  proceed?  Well,
primarily because it does not match our grammar well.

<pre>
<b>noun_phrase</b> -> <b>determiner</b> <b>noun_phrase</b>
</pre>

<p> There's no  way we  could extend  the kind of  parser we  see above  to
handle a language  with a complex  grammar. Instead we  should rely on  our
little parsers being designed to work together to make a big parser.



<a name = "parse_noun_phrase"> </a>
<h4> <tt>parse_noun_phrase</tt> recognises if a sequence of words begins
with a noun_phrase.</h4>

Let us consider a workable definition of <tt>parse_noun_phrase</tt>.

<p> At  (1) we  call  <tt>parse_determiner</tt> to  see  if it  can  find a
determiner at the start of the list of tokens. If (2) it has succeeded,  we
call   (3)   <tt>parse_noun</tt>   to   find   a   noun   starting    where
<tt>parse_determiner</tt> left off. If this second parse has succeeded (4),
then (5) we create a parse-record whose tree (6) consists of the trees from
the parse-record for the determiner (7)  and from the noun-record (8).  The
list of  remaining  tokens  (9)  for the  parse-record  consists  of  those
remaining from the parsing  of the noun. If  the second parse failed  (10),
then we return <tt>#f</tt>, and likewise if the first parse failed (11)  we
return <tt>#f</tt>.


<pre>
(define parse_noun_phrase
  (lambda (list_of_tokens)
      (let ((p_det (parse_determiner list_of_tokens)))     ; (1)
          (if p_det                                        ; (2)
              (let ( (p_n (parse_noun (rest_parse p_det)))); (3)
                  (if p_n                                  ; (4)
                      (cons_parse                          ; (5)
                          (list 'noun_phrase               ; (6)
                              (tree_parse p_det)           ; (7)
                              (tree_parse p_n))            ; (8)
                          (rest_parse p_n)                 ; (9)
                          )                                ;
                      #f)                                  ;(10)
                  );end let                                ;
              #f)                                          ;(11)
          );end let                                        ;
      )); end def. parse_noun_phrase                       ;
</pre>

<p>
Now we can try this out

<pre>
    (parse_noun_phrase '(the cat eats the canary))
</pre>

<p>
obtaining


<pre>
    &lt;parse  (noun_phrase the cat) (eats the canary)>
</pre>

<p>
So, here the <tt>tree_parse</tt> component of the <tt>parse</tt> record is
a tree <tt> '(noun_phrase the cat) </tt>, while the <tt>rest_parse</tt>
component is <tt>'(eats the canary)</tt>, that is the original list with
the noun-phrase removed.


<p>
and, if the parse  fails:

<pre>
    (parse_noun_phrase '(eats the canary))
</pre>

<p>
we get

<pre>
    #f
</pre>

<p>
Likewise if we have a determiner first, but no noun second:

<pre>
    (parse_noun_phrase '(the the canary))
</pre>

<p>
we get

<pre>
    #f
</pre>

We are going to get fed up with changing the names of the <tt>p_...</tt>
variables,
so let us call them <tt>p1</tt> and <tt>p2</tt>.


<pre>
(define parse_verb_phrase
    (lambda (list_of_tokens)
        (let ((p1 (parse_verb list_of_tokens)))
            (if p1
                (let ((p2 (parse_noun_phrase (rest_parse p1))))
                    (if p2
                        (cons_parse
                            (list 'verb_phrase
                                (tree_parse p1)
                                (tree_parse p2))
                            (rest_parse p2)
                            )
                        #f)
                    ) ;end let
                #f)
            );end let
        )); end def. parse_verb_phrase
</pre>



<pre>
(example '(parse_verb_phrase '(eats the canary))
    (cons_parse '(verb_phrase eats (noun_phrase the canary))
        '())
    )
</pre>

<p>
Now we can define a <b>sentence</b> of the English Language

<pre>
    <b>sentence</b> -> <b>noun_phrase</b> <b>verb_phrase</b>
</pre>



<a name = "parse_sentence"> </a>
<h4> <tt>parse_sentence</tt> recognises if a sequence of words begins
with a sentence.</h4>


<pre>
(define parse_sentence
    (lambda (list_of_tokens)
        (let ((p1 (parse_noun_phrase list_of_tokens)))
            (if p1
                (let ((p2 (parse_verb_phrase (rest_parse p1))))
                    (if p2
                        (cons_parse
                            (list 'sentence
                                (tree_parse p1)
                                (tree_parse p2))
                            (rest_parse p2)
                            )
                        #f)
                    ) ;end let
                #f)
            );end let
        )); end def. parse_sentence
</pre>

<p>
Now we  can try  out our  complete sentence-parser.  If we  try it  on  the
sentence <tt>'(the cat eats the canary)</tt> we see that we obtain a parse:


<pre>
(example
    '(parse_sentence '(the cat eats the canary))
    (cons_parse
        '(sentence (noun_phrase the cat)     ; parse-tree
            (verb_phrase eats
                (noun_phrase the canary)))    ; end of parse-tree
        '()                                   ; unparsed
        )                                     ; end of parse
    )
</pre>

<p>
If we give it a non-sentence like <tt>'(canary the cat eats)</tt> we get:

<pre>
(example
    '(parse_sentence '(canary the cat eats))
    #f)
</pre>

<p>
that is, the parse fails.

<p>
If we give it a list that begins with a <b>sentence</b>, but which has some
nonsense at the end. We can use the <tt>example</tt> capability to
compare the result of the parse (1) with what we expect (2). Run the
example - it works!


<pre>
(example
    '(parse_sentence '(the dog eats the bone 4 5 6))   ;(1)
    (cons_parse                                        ;(2)
        '(sentence (noun_phrase the dog)
            (verb_phrase eats
                (noun_phrase the bone)))
        '(4 5 6)
        )
    )
</pre>

<p>
Here we have the parse-tree:

<pre>
    '(sentence (noun_phrase the dog)
         (verb_phrase eats
             (noun_phrase the bone)))
</pre>

<p>
while the unparsed residual is the list <tt> '(4 5 6) </tt>.

<p>
Naturally(!) there is quite a lot our parser does not know about English. For
example, if we try out



<pre>
(example
    '(parse_sentence
        '(the cat eats the canary with the yellow feathers))
    (cons_parse '(sentence (noun_phrase the cat)
            (verb_phrase eats
                (noun_phrase the canary)))
                    '(with the yellow feathers)
        )
    )
</pre>

<p>
that is the  prepositional phrase <tt>'(with  the yellow feathers)</tt>  is
left unrecognised. Note that this form of sentence also poses a problem  of
<em>ambiguity</em> - does the canary  have yellow feathers? or perhaps  the
cat uses yellow feathers as an instrument with which to eat the unfortunate
bird. <em>We</em> know  that canaries are  yellow-feathered birds and  that
cats are not given to using tools as instruments - but that is <em>semantic
knowledge</em> that  cannot  readily be  built  into syntax.  The  parallel
sentence "the man eats
the turkey with the knife and fork", has the opposite
structure.

Ambiguity can occur in computer languages, but language designers try to
avoid it.

Moreover we can parse nonsense sentences such as:


<pre>
(example
    '(parse_sentence '(the cabbage eats the man))
    ( cons_parse
     '(sentence (noun_phrase the cabbage)
         (verb_phrase eats
             (noun_phrase the man)))
     '()
     )
    )
</pre>


<p>
Distinguishing grammatically correct sense from grammatically correct nonsense
is an issue of <em>semantics</em>.

<h2> <a name="trace">The <tt>trace</tt> function can be used for checking
out parsers.</a></h2>


<p>
We can make good use of the <tt>trace</tt> function to help us debug our
parsers. Below is  a trace, slightly edited to make it viewable on a
web-browser.

<pre>
    (trace parse_verb_phrase)
    (trace parse_verb)
    (trace parse_noun_phrase)

    (parse_verb_phrase '(eats the canary))
</pre>
Produces the output
<pre>
    (parse_verb_phrase  (eats the canary) )
    |(parse_verb  (eats the canary) )
    |parse_verb   = <parse  eats  (the canary)>
    |(parse_noun_phrase  (the canary) )
    |parse_noun_phrase   = <parse  (noun_phrase the canary) ()>
    parse_verb_phrase   = <parse  (verb_phrase eats (noun_phrase the canary))
         ()>

    <parse  (verb_phrase eats (noun_phrase the canary)) ()>

</pre>
