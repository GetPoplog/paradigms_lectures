<p>
Computers need to recognise whether a  sequence
of objects forms a valid statement in a <em>language</em>.

<p> Consider

<pre>
     x := x + 1
</pre>


<pre>
     the cat eats the canary.
</pre>



<p>  A   <em>parser</em>   is   a  Scheme   function   which   recognises a
<em>phrase</em> in a language,

<p>For English,  some
well-formed part of a sentence.

<p>
<tt>"the  cat"</tt>
is a phrase of the  English language.

<p>
Why do  we focus on recognising  <em>
phrases</em>?

<p>
A sentence is complicated - built up out of phrases

<HR>


We can  systematically build up a  parser
for a  given language  by  building up  parsers  to recognise  ever  larger
phrases of  the language.

<p>For English:  create  parsers  to   recognise

<p> <em>nouns</em>,
<p> <em>determiners</em> (the words "a" and "the")

<p>use these to build parser
for recognising <em>noun-phrases</em>

<p>we build a parser for sentences out of noun- and verb- phrase parsers.

<HR>

<p> Languages are defined by <em>grammars</em>.

<p>Grammars are written  using <em>productions</em>,

<pre>
    <b>sentence</b>  -> <b>noun_phrase</b> <b>verb_phrase</b>
</pre>

<p> says that a sentence is a noun-phrase followed by a verb-phrase.

<HR>


<p>In Scheme terms, the sentence:


<pre>
    '(the cat eats the canary)
</pre>

<p>is made appending the noun-phrase  <tt>the cat</tt>

<p>to the verb-phrase <tt>eats the canary</tt>.

<pre>
    (append '(the cat) '(eats the canary))
</pre>

<hr>

<p> <em>terminal  symbols</em>
are those entities in the grammar which cannot be rewritten.

<p>They are words (or "tokens", or "lexemes") of the language.

<p>Those entities
in the grammar which  can
be rewritten are  called "non-terminal  symbols".


<p>We shall use  the notation that  we have already  been using informally
 to descibe Scheme,  in  which  non-terminals  are  written  using
<b>bold</b>
typewriter characters, while  terminals are written  using plain  tyewriter
characters.

<hr>

A grammar for a small subset of English

<pre>
    <b>sentence</b>  -> <b>noun_phrase</b> <b>verb_phrase</b>

    <b>noun_phrase</b>  -> <b>determiner</b> <b>noun</b>

    <b>determiner</b>   -> the
    <b>determiner</b>   -> a

    <b>noun</b>  -> cat
    <b>noun</b>  -> dog
    <b>noun</b>  -> canary

    <b>verb_phrase</b> -> <b>verb</b> <b>noun_phrase</b>
    <b>verb</b>   -> eats
    <b>verb</b>   -> likes
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
For convenience, the vertical bar can be used to indicate alternative
Right Hand Sides


<pre>
    <b>verb</b>   -> eats | likes
</pre>

<TABLE BORDER=2>
<TR>
<TD>
The earliest convention  for writing productions used by computer
scientists is  Backus-Naur  Form (BNF),  in  which  non-terminal
symbols are enclosed in angle brackets. For example

<pre>
    &LTsentence> -> &LTnoun_phrase> &LTverb_phrase>
    &LTdeterminer> -> the

</pre>

</TD>
</TR>
<TR> <TD>
Another convention that is used is to quote terminal symbols, thus:
<pre>
    sentence -> noun_phrase verb_phrase
    determiner -> "the"
</pre>
</TD></TR>

<h2><A name = "parsing">Parsing a Sentence in a Language</a></h2>


<p>
A <em>parser</em>
is a function which recognises that  a particular  sequence  of
terminal symbols is a legal statement in a language.

<p>
Practical applications  of parsers  usually require  that
some kind of <em>parse-tree</em> is produced  to represent the logical
structure  of
the statement.

<p>A compiler  needs a  parse-tree in  order  to
generate code.

<p>A  natural language query  system requires a  parse tree  in
order to "understand" a question put to it and to generate an answer.

<hr>

<p>
In computer science  we  call the  terminal symbols
fed  to a  parser "tokens"

<hr>

<p>
Use
Scheme expressions to represent parse-trees. So, a Pascal parser might
parse:

<pre>
    '(x + 2 * y)
</pre>

<p>
as the Scheme structure

<pre>
    '(+ x (* 2 y))
</pre>

<hr>

<p>

Suppose we define a parser as  a function that takes a list of  tokens
and returns a parse-tree.

<p>Raises two problems

<p> we have to find some way of signalling that a list  of
tokens is not in fact  a sentence of the language
<tt>#f</tt>

<p>sure that <tt>#f</tt> cant be mistaken  for an actual parse-tree?

<p>
Compositionality.
<p>
Hopeless  to try to  write one huge  function
which will perform a parse of a complex language.

<p>Have to build a parser out of smaller functions that we write.

<p>What sort
of functions?

<p>Build big parsers out of smaller ones.

<hr>

We can use the  <em>language definition</em> as a guide to doing this.

<pre>
    <b>sentence</b>  -> <b>noun_phrase</b> <b>verb_phrase</b>
</pre>

<p>
We want a parser for a <b>sentence</b> - so build it out of a parser
for  the grammatical class

<p>
<b>noun_phrase</b>

<p>
and a  parser  for the  class  verb_phrase.

<hr>

<p>
Suppose  we  want  our <b>sentence</b>-parser to parse this sentence:

<pre>
    (the cat eats the canary)
</pre>

<p>
What text are the <b>noun_phrase</b>  parser and the   verb_phrase parser going to
have to work on?

<p>The <b>noun_phrase</b>-parser is going to work on the
whole list:

<pre>
    (the cat eats the canary)
</pre>

<p>
recognising <tt>(the cat)</tt> as being a <b>noun_phrase</b>.

<p> The <b>verb_phrase</b>-parser is
going to have to work on <tt>(eats
the  canary)</tt>.

<p>We have to provide some  way
of giving it its  correct argument.

<hr>
A false trail

<p>
How about the
<tt>cddr</tt> of  the
original list

<p>
Wewould be making  the assumption that  each noun  phrase
consists of exactly  two tokens,

<p> <tt>(the
furry cat  eats the canary)</tt>.

<p>A bad mistake when creating parsers to assume that any given grammatical
class had a fixed length.

<hr>

<p>
Better: require a parser  to return  result a record  which
contains

<p><em>part of the original list of tokens which remains
unparsed</em>.

<p>That
way we  can slot the  two parsers  for noun phrases  and verb  phrases
together (or any other two).

<p>We can  think of the first parser as  "eating"
tokens until it  is satisfied,  when what remains  is given  to the  second
parser.

<hr>


<p>
If we are using  UMASS Scheme we  can define a record  class for parses  as
follows:

<pre>
(define class_parse (record-class 'parse '(full full)))

(define cons_parse   (car class_parse))
(define sel_parse    (caddr class_parse))
(define tree_parse   (car sel_parse))
(define rest_parse   (cadr sel_parse))
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
Now, a parser can signal failure by returning <tt>#f</tt>
without risk of confusion,
since if it succeeds it will always return one of these parse-records.

<hr>

<p>
Thus we can regard a parser as a function which takes as argument a list of
tokens and returns as result

<UL>
<LI>
    EITHER a parse whose <tt>tree_parse</tt> is a <em>parse-tree</em>
    of a recognised phrase and whose <tt>rest_parse</tt> is the remainder
    of the list when the phrase is "bitten off".
<LI>
    OR <tt>#f</tt>,
to indicate that the argument-list does not begin with the
            required phrase.
</UL>

<hr>
<p>
For example, we might  write a parser which  recognised expressions in  the
Pascal language.
internal form)

<p>The Pascal expression
<tt> x+2*y </tt> would be represented by the Scheme

<pre>
    (+ x (* 2 y))
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
Thus suppose we have a parser for Pascal



<pre>
    (define p
        (parse_pascal '(x + 2 * y ; z := 4;))
        )
</pre>

<p>
then the Scheme variable <tt>p</tt>  will have the value which prints as:

<pre>
        &LTparse (begin (+ x (* 2 y)) (:= z 4)) '()>
</pre>

<p>
if we choose an obvious way to represent Pascal as Scheme.

<hr>

<p>
To make a parser for the  whole English language is <em>hard</em>
<p> Even to make
a parser  for a programming  language is quite  hard.

<p> However, let  us
make a start

<pre>
    <b>noun_phrase</b> ->  <b>determiner</b> <b>noun</b>
    <b>determiner</b>   -> the
    <b>determiner</b>   -> a
</pre>

That is to  say, a <b>determiner</b>  is the  word "a" or  "the".

<hr>
<p>

Lets write a parser for <b>determiner</b>

<p>The  function takes a list of
tokens  as argument.

<p>If (1) the list of  tokens begins with the symbol
<tt>'a</tt>  or
with the symbol <tt>'the</tt>,we  have a determiner,
<p>so  (2) create a parse-record

<hr>

<pre>
(define parse_determiner
    (lambda (list_of_tokens)
        (if (member? (car list_of_tokens) '(a the))    ; (1) determiner there?
            (cons_parse                                ; (2) yes! make parse
                (car list_of_tokens)                   ; (3) tree
                (cdr list_of_tokens))                  ; (4) unparsed list
            #f ) ))                                    ; (5) fail
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
We will need the definition of <tt>member?</tt> from Lecture 5:

<pre>
(define (member? x list)
     (if (null? list) #f
         (if (equal? x (car list)) #t
              (member? x (cdr list)))))
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
We can now try this out.

<pre>
    (parse_determiner '(the cat eats the canary))
</pre>

<p>
returns the parse-record:

<pre>
    &LTparse the (cat eats the canary)>
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>tree_parse</tt> component of the <tt>parse</tt> record is
the symbol <tt> 'the </tt>
<p>the <tt>rest_parse</tt>
component is <tt>'(eats the canary)</tt>, that is the original list with
the determiner removed.
<hr>


<p>
While if there is no determiner:

<pre>
    (parse_determiner '(eats the canary))
</pre>

<p>
we get

<pre>
    #f
</pre>

<hr>


<p>
Note that there  is a bug  in this function,  we have not  allowed for  the
possibility that the list of tokens might be empty. We'll mend this later.

<p>
Likewise we could define a <b>noun</b> as a member of a list of words known
to be nouns. Now there  are tens if not hundreds  of thousands of nouns  in
the English language, so this would be  a long list (and expensive to  look
through), but we can restrict our vocabulary.

<hr>
<pre>
(define noun '(cat dog child woman man bone cabbage canary))

(define parse_noun
    (lambda (list_of_tokens)
        (if (member? (car list_of_tokens) noun)
            (cons_parse (car list_of_tokens)
                (cdr list_of_tokens))
            #f ) ))
</pre>

<hr>

<p> Now, can we write a parser  for a <b>noun_phrase</b>?


Make  use of  our two existing  parsers, rather  than
trying to write a function  that sees if the <tt>list_of_tokens</tt>  has a
determiner as a first word and a noun as second. This is NOT what we should
do:


<pre>
(define parse_noun_phrase
    (lambda (list_of_tokens)         ; DONT DO THIS
        (if (and
                (member? (car list_of_tokens) '(a the))
                (member? (cadr list_of_tokens) noun)
                )
            (cons_parse
                (list 'noun_phrase   (car list_of_tokens)
                    (cadr list_of_tokens))
                (cddr list_of_tokens)
                )
            #f)
        ))
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
Consider our grammar


<pre>
<b>noun_phrase</b> -> <b>determiner</b> <b>noun_phrase</b>
</pre>

<p> There's no  way we  could extend  the kind of  parser we  see above  to
handle a language  with a complex  grammar. Instead we  should rely on  our
little parsers being designed to work together to make a big parser.

<hr>


<pre>
(define parse_noun_phrase
  (lambda (list_of_tokens)
      (let ((p_det (parse_determiner list_of_tokens)))     ; (1)
          (if p_det                                        ; (2)
              (let ( (p_n (parse_noun (rest_parse p_det)))); (3)
                  (if p_n                                  ; (4)
                      (cons_parse                          ; (5)
                          (list 'noun_phrase               ; (6)
                              (tree_parse p_det)           ; (7)
                              (tree_parse p_n))            ; (8)
                          (rest_parse p_n)                 ; (9)
                          )                                ;
                      #f)                                  ;(10)
                  );end let                                ;
              #f)                                          ;(11)
          );end let                                        ;
      )); end def. parse_noun_phrase                       ;
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
Now we can try this out

<pre>
    (parse_noun_phrase '(the cat eats the canary))
</pre>

<p>
obtaining

<pre>
    &LTparse  (noun_phrase the cat) (eats the canary)>
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
The <tt>tree_parse</tt> component of the <tt>parse</tt> record is
<p> <tt> '(noun_phrase the cat) </tt>,

<p> the <tt>rest_parse</tt>
component is <tt>'(eats the canary)</tt>

<p>the original list with the noun-phrase removed.

<hr>

<p>
and, if the parse  fails:

<pre>
    (parse_noun_phrase '(eats the canary))
</pre>

<p>
we get

<pre>
    #f
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
Also if we have a determiner first, but no noun second:

<pre>
    (parse_noun_phrase '(the the canary))
</pre>

<p>
we get

<pre>
    #f
</pre>

<hr>

<pre>
(define verb '(likes eats hugs))

(define (parse_verb list_of_tokens)
    (if (member? (car list_of_tokens) verb)
        (cons_parse (car list_of_tokens) (cdr list_of_tokens))
        #f ) )
</pre>

<p>
We are going to get fed up with changing the names of the <tt>p_...</tt>
variables,
so let us call them <tt>p1</tt> and <tt>p2</tt>.

<hr>

<pre>
(define parse_verb_phrase
    (lambda (list_of_tokens)
        (let ((p1 (parse_verb list_of_tokens)))
            (if p1
                (let ((p2 (parse_noun_phrase (rest_parse p1))))
                    (if p2
                        (cons_parse
                            (list 'verb_phrase
                                (tree_parse p1)
                                (tree_parse p2))
                            (rest_parse p2)
                            )
                        #f)
                    ) ;end let
                #f)
            );end let
        )); end def. parse_verb_phrase
</pre>

<hr>

<pre>
(example '(parse_verb_phrase '(eats the canary))
    (cons_parse '(verb_phrase eats (noun_phrase the canary))
        '())
    )
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
Now we can define a <b>sentence</b> of the English Language

<pre>
    <b>sentence</b> -> <b>noun_phrase</b> <b>verb_phrase</b>
</pre>

<hr>

<pre>
(define parse_sentence
    (lambda (list_of_tokens)
        (let ((p1 (parse_noun_phrase list_of_tokens)))
            (if p1
                (let ((p2 (parse_verb_phrase (rest_parse p1))))
                    (if p2
                        (cons_parse
                            (list 'sentence
                                (tree_parse p1)
                                (tree_parse p2))
                            (rest_parse p2)
                            )
                        #f)
                    ) ;end let
                #f)
            );end let
        )); end def. parse_sentence
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
Now we can try out our complete sentence-parser. If we try it on the
sentence <tt>'(the
cat eats the canary)</tt> we see that we obtain a parse:


<pre>
(example
    '(parse_sentence '(the cat eats the canary))
    (cons_parse
        '(sentence (noun_phrase the cat)     ; parse-tree
            (verb_phrase eats
                (noun_phrase the canary)))    ; end of parse-tree
        '()                                   ; unparsed
        )                                     ; end of parse
    )
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
If we give it a non-sentence like <tt>'(canary the cat eats)</tt> we get:

<pre>
(example
    '(parse_sentence '(canary the cat eats))
    #f)
</pre>

<p>
that is, the parse fails.

<p>
Give it a <b>sentence</b> with
nonsense at the end.

<p>We can use the <tt>example</tt> capability to
compare the result of the parse (1) with what we expect (2).

<p>Run the
example - it works!

<hr>

<pre>
(example
    '(parse_sentence '(the dog eats the bone 4 5 6))   ;(1)
    (cons_parse                                        ;(2)
        '(sentence (noun_phrase the dog)
            (verb_phrase eats
                (noun_phrase the bone)))
        '(4 5 6)
        )
    )
</pre>


<hr>

<pre>
(example
    '(parse_sentence
        '(the cat eats the canary with the yellow feathers))
    (cons_parse '(sentence (noun_phrase the cat)
            (verb_phrase eats
                (noun_phrase the canary)))
                    '(with the yellow feathers)
        )
    )
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
that is the  prepositional phrase <tt>'(with  the yellow feathers)</tt>  is
left unrecognised. Note that this form of sentence also poses a problem  of
<em>ambiguity</em> - does the canary  have yellow feathers? or perhaps  the
cat uses yellow feathers as an instrument with which to eat the unfortunate
bird. <em>We</em> know  that canaries are  yellow-feathered birds and  that
cats are not given to using tools as instruments - but that is <em>semantic
knowledge</em> that  cannot  readily be  built  into syntax.  The  parallel
sentence "the man eat the turkey with the knife and fork", has the opposite
structure.

<hr>

Ambiguity can occur in computer languages, but language designers try to
avoid it.

<hr>

We can parse nonsense sentences such as:


<pre>
(example
    '(parse_sentence '(the cabbage eats the man))
    ( cons_parse
     '(sentence (noun_phrase the cabbage)
         (verb_phrase eats
             (noun_phrase the man)))
     '()
     )
    )
</pre>



<p>
Distinguishing grammatically correct sense from grammatically correct nonsense
is an issue of <em>semantics</em>.
