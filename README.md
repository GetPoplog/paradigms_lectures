# Programming Language Paradigms lectures

A course on programming language paradigms originally given at UMASS by
Prof. Robin Popplestone. 


----


These lecture notes were passed onto Prof Aaron Sloman for hosting on the 
University of Birmingham's Comp Sci Department public research site. They 
were transferred to myself, Stephen Leach, in July 2024 to find a new
permanent home.

The dates given in the files seem to range from 1995-1998 but I don't have
any other details at the moment.
