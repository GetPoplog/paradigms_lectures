<p>Michie
begins by setting the idea in the context of machine-learning, with
particular reference to Samuel's checkers program. The most definitive
text is

<ul>
  The present proposals involve a particular way of looking at functions.
  This point  of view asserts that a function is not to be identified with
  the operation by which it is evaluated (the rule for finding the
  factorial, for instance) nor with its representation in the form of a
  table or other look-up medium (such as a table of factorials). A function
  is a function, and the means chosen to find its value in a given case is
  independent of the function's intrinisic meaning. This is no more than a
  retatement of a mathematical truism, but it is one which has been lost
  sight of by the designers of our programming languages. By resurrecting
  this truism we become free to assert: (1) that the apparatus of
evaluation
  associated with any given function shall consist of a "rule part"
  (computational procedure) and a "rote part" (lookup table); (2) that
  evaluation in the computer shall on each given occasion proceed whether
  by rule, or by rote, or by a blend of the two, solely as dictated by the
  expediency of the moment; (3) that the rule versus rote decisions shall
be
  handled by the machine behind the scenes; and (4) that various kinds of
  interaction be permitted to occur between the rule part and the rote
part.
</ul>
<p>
Michie elaborates on (4),

<ul>
  Thus each evaluation by rule adds a fresh entry to the rote.
</ul>

Which is, I think close to the current understanding of memoisation, but
adds
<ul>
  The rule itself may be self-modifying and seek to increase its
  agreement with the contents of the rote. [which may have been
  set up or modified independently from the operation of the rule].
</ul>

<p>So, from Michie's perspective, something like data-mining (at least as
incorporated in Clementine) is also an instance of memoisation.

<p>There
follows  a discussion  of a  humanised scenario  in which  a  person,
needing, on call,  to evaluate a  mathematical function (hcf)  from a  rule
could improve his performance by constructing a card-index (the rote).

<p>He
then discusses the effect of integrating a rote into the evaluation of
recursively defined functions.

<ul>
  I shall suppose that a "card index" regime for the evaluation of
  functions is available, so that we have facilities for converting
  functions into "memo-functions". Because this can only be done at all
  easily using an open-ended programming language free of arbitrary
  constraints, I shall conduct my illustration inf POP-2 which has the
  further advantage that the needed facilitiy is actually available
  in the form of a half a dozen POP-2 library routines.
<p>
  We define the rule part of factorial as follows:

<pre>
        function fact n;
            if n<0 or if not (n.isinteger) then undef else
            if n = 0 then 1 else n * fact(n-1) close
            end
</pre>
</ul>
[there are in fact two syntax-errors here - the "if" before the "not" is
erroneous - the "else <newline> if" should be
"elseif". In POP-2 "n.isinteger" was a syntactic variant of isinteger(n).
"close" means "end if".]
<p>
Michie continues:

<ul>
    To endow fact with the "memo" facility, using Popplestone's routines,
    we merely write

<pre>
        newmemo(fact,100,nonop=) -> fact;
</pre>

    This replaces the old definition of fact with a new one with a memo
    apparatus attached, such that the rote has an upper fixed limit of 100
    entries and uses the "=" relaation for look-up purposes.
</ul>


[nonop in POP-2 was the way of passing an infix as a parameter, and the
"->" notation is an assignment  value -> variable].
