<h2> Discussion </h2>
If we want to regard computation as being <em>algebraic</em> in nature,
then it is natural to think of Shonfinkel's combinators as providing a
basis. Thus, we would think of having an algebra U, called a
<em>computational universe</em> in which the laws

<ul>
        <b>S</b> f g x = (f x) (g x)  <br>
        <b>K</b> k x   = k
</ul>

hold. </p>

We would like such a universe to be countably infinite, but will clearly
have to accept that many problems, such as the equality of its members,
will be undecidable.



<p>We do not want to be prescriptive about a particular universe. For a  start
we are not taking a <em> reductionist  </em> approach, in which a universe  is
constructed from an ultra-simple base.  For, while a reductionist approach  is
intellectually satisfying, it  fails to address  the engineering realities  of
the construction  of any  programming language,  namely that  any  programming
language is implemented on  an existing computer which  will offer a range  of
quite complex capabilities. Moreover, since it is desirable for a language  to
be implementable on a range of computers, it is better that it be specified in
terms of  a relatively  high-level universe,  which can  then be  mapped  to a
specific computer.

<p>
Given that we expect to incorporate some quite high-level operations in our
universes, it is useful to avoid prescribing exactly what they are, beyond
the minimum required to achieve a computational capability. For different
programming languages can be considered as defined on different basis of
primitive operations.

<p>[Note for the html form of the document - we shall write <= for set
inclusion, \/ for set-union and /\ for set intersection. We shall also
use == to denote an equivalence operation]

<h4>Definition of Universe</h4>
A computational universe is an algebra U with a single non-associative
operator (called "application") subject to the  axioms below. We write
application as juxtaposition, so that  u<sub>1</sub> u<sub>2</sub> denotes
the application of the element u<sub>1</sub> of U to the element
u<sub>2</sub> of U.

<ul>
<li>  U1  There is an element <b>K</b> in U with the property that (<b>K</b> k) x = k
          for all k, x in U, x not in E.
<li>  U2  There is a subset  Str <=U of <em>strict operations</em>
<li>  U3  There is a subset  E <= U, with the property that  e x = e,
          x e = e for all e in E, x in Str. The members of E are called
          <em>exceptions</em>.
<li>  U4  There is an element <b>S</b> in U with the property that for all
          f, g, x in U  for which one of the two following conditions
holds:
<ul>
<li> <i><b>S</b> f g x = (f x) (g x)</i>
<li>    <i> <b>S</b> f g x</i> in </i>E</i>
</ul>
<li>   U4  U is finitely generated from a base-set B <= U.

</ul>

<p>If the set E is empty, we say that U is a universe without exceptions.

<p>Remark: the above axioms are characteristic of an eager language. For
under lazy evaluation, the argument of (<b>K</b> k) x would not be evaluated, so
there would be no way of discovering if it were an exception.


<h3>Free Universes.</h3>

Let B be a set of base elements. We define a term in B as follows

<ul>
<li>  b in B is a term.
<li>  if t<sub>1</sub> and t<sub>2</sub> are terms then the formal product
      (t<sub>1</sub> t<sub>2</sub>) is a term.
<li>  there is a distinct term <b>S</b>
<li>  there is a distinct term <b>K</b>
</ul>

Then the <em> free computational universe </em>  Free(B) is the set of
equivalence classes of terms of B under the laws:

<ul>
<li> F1: <b>K</b> k x == k
<li>  F2: <b>S</b> f g x == (f x) (g x)
</ul>

<p>
That is, the equivalence relation is the symmetric and transitive closure
of  t<sub>1</sub>->t<sub>2</sub>  iff t<sub>1</sub> can be converted into t<sub>2</sub> by substituting an instance of
the left-hand-side of F1 or F2 by the corresponding instance of its RHS.

<p> Let us denote by <i>t'</i> the equivalence class to which a given term
<i>t</i> belongs.

<hr>

<h4> Theorem </h4>
For any finite set B, Free(B) is a non-strict computational universe
which is exception free.

<h4>Proof</h4>
Firstly, we need the following lemmas, the first of which shows that
application is well-defined,

<ul>

<h4>Lemma</h4>
if t<sub>11</sub>==t<sub>21</sub>
and t<sub>12</sub>==t<sub>22</sub>
then (t<sub>11</sub> t<sub>12</sub>) == (t<sub>21</sub> t<sub>22</sub>)

<h4> Proof (sketch) </h4>

By the definition of equivalence, we can transform t<sub>11</sub>
to t<sub>21</sub> by a sequence of applications of the laws F1 and
F2. Likewise we can transform t<sub>12</sub>
to t<sub>22</sub> by a sequence of applications of F1
and F2. We can combine these sequences to transform (t<sub>11</sub> t<sub>12</sub>) to (t<sub>21</sub> t<sub>22</sub>).
Hence (t<sub>11</sub> t<sub>12</sub>) == (t<sub>21</sub> t<sub>22</sub>)

<h4>Lemma</h4>
If t1 and t2 are terms, then the term (<b>K</b> t1 t2) == t1.

<h4>Proof</h4>

This is immediate from the definition of ==.


<h4>Lemma</h4>
If t1, t2 and t3 are terms, then the term (<b>S</b> t1 t2 t3) == (t1 t3) (t2 t3)

<h4>Proof</h4>

Again, this is immediate from the definition of ==.

</ul>


Let us denote the equivalence class of a term <i>t</i> by <i>t'</i>.
then it is clear that for all equivalence classes k' x',

<ul>
    <b>K</b>' k' x'  = (<b>K</b> k)' x'  -----[by definition of application]<br>
    = (<b>K</b> k x)' -----------[by definition of application]<br>
    = k' ---------------[by definition of equivalence]
</ul>

and for all equivalence classes  f' g' x'

<ul>
<b>S</b>' f' g' x' = (<b>S</b> f)' g' x' = (<b>S</b> f g)' x' = (<b>S</b> f g x)'
---by definition of application<br>

 = ((f x) (g x))'--------------------by definition of equivalence<br>
= (f x)' (g x)' = (f' x') (g' x') -------by definition of application<br>
</ul>

We can take the exception-set E of the universe to be the empty-set {}.
Given that E is empty, all operations are non-strict.

<hr>

<p>
So, it seems that we have a countably infinite model of a computational
universe. It should be noted that this is not a constructive algebra in the
sense that we can decide whether any two members are equal - the word
problem is insoluble. However it does mean that we can go ahead with a
clear conscience and prove a few things about computational universes
without the agonising suspicion that we are talking about nothing.

<hr>
<h4>Lemma </h4>
If U is a computational universe with Shonfinkel combinators <b>S</b> and <b>K</b> and
exception set E,
then
for all u in U, u not in E, <b>SKK</b>u = u.

<h4>
Proof</h4>  SKKu = (Ku)(Ku) = u.

<p>
[??? this is flawed - we have to allow that S may crash on non-exception
arguments, cos we can render the Y-combinator in SK terms. So we need some
concept of ]

<hr>

<h4>Definition</h4>
We shall call <b>SKK</b> the <b>I</b>-combinator.

<hr>

<h2>Types of Object</h2>
<p> In general we are interested in being able to prove properties of
expressions in a given computational universe. In particular, we will be
anxious to know in what circumstances an exception can arise. While proving
that an exception can <em>never</em> occur is a hard problem, we can quite
easily predict circumstances in which an exception will occur.

<p>Following the standard approach of computer science, we introduce the
notion of <em>types</em> of object.


<h4>Definition</h4>
Let U be a computational universe. Then a type T<=U is a subset of U.

<h4> Discussion</h4>
The above definition of type is non-constructive. It will serve nevertheless
to establish some basic attributes of types. Naturally we will have to
find a way of constructively specifying a range of types sufficiently
diversified as to support worthwhile discovery of erroneous code. However our
investigation of non-constructive types will identify operations that we need
to perform constructively.



<p>
To see the difficulty of proving that an exception can never occur,
consider the exception raised by division by zero.
We might think that we could elaborate our type-system to avoid the
possibility of well-typed expressions raising an exception, but this can
rapidly be seen to be impossible -  consider the rational function:

<pre>
                 P[x]
    R[x]   =   --------
                 Q[x]
</pre>

<p>
to know whether R[x] will raise an exception, we have to know the zeros of the
polynomial Q[x], which is a non-trivial (and indeed in a certain sense,
insoluble) problem. Even if we relaxed our requirement to "f(a) evaluates
without exception almost everywhere in A", we still have problems, since to
know that this statement is true of R[x] requires knowledge, if not of
the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, at least of the fact that a polynomial can
have at most n roots, which, if not exactly a profound theorem, is certainly
beyond the scope of knowledge that it is reasonable to expect a type-system to
possess.


<h4>Definition</h4>
Let U be a computational universe, with exception set E. We say that p in U is
a procedure if for some u in U, the application (p u) is not in E.

<p>
We denote the type of procedures of U by Proc(U), and of exceptions by
Exc(U).


<p>


<h4>Definition</h4>

If U is a universe and D and R are types of U, then D->R is the type

<ul>
    {p | p in Proc(U) & All d. d in D implies (p d) in R }
</ul>

<p>
Thus if <i>p</i> is a procedure, we say that <i>p</i> has the type D->R if <i>p</i> in D->R. It
should be noted that in general, <em>no unique function-type can be
ascribed to a procedure</em>.  For a given procedure object <i>p</i>
it is possible that
<i>p in  D<sub>1</sub> -> R<sub>1</sub></i>
and also  <i>p in D<sub>2</sub> -> R<sub>2</sub></i> where there is
way of subsuming these two relationships in the form of
<i>p in  D<sub>3</sub> -> R<sub>3</sub></i> without losing useful
discriminatory power. For example, the absolute value function in most
first-generation Lisp derivative languages belongs to the following
function-types:

<ul>
abs in Integer -> Integer <br>
abs in Number -> Number
</ul>

But the second does not subsume the first, because the first statement
tells us the relevant fact that if we give <i>abs</i> an integer as
argument it returns an integer as result.

<p>

<hr>

<h4>Lemma (contravariance of domain, covariance of range)</h4>

<p>
If D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>,
are types for which D<sub>2</sub><=D<sub>1</sub> and
R<sub>1</sub><=R<sub>2</sub>,
then  D<sub>1</sub>->R<sub>1</sub>
<= D<sub>2</sub>->R<sub>2</sub>


<h4>Proof</h4>

<p>
Let <i>p in D<sub>1</sub>->R<sub>1</sub></i>.

Then <i>(p d<sub>1</sub>)</i> in <i>R<sub>1</sub></i>
for all <i>d<sub>1</sub> in D<sub>1</sub></i>.

<p>But D<sub>2</sub><=D<sub>1</sub>. Hence
for all d<sub>2</sub> in D<sub>2</sub>, (p d<sub>2</sub>) in R<sub>1</sub>.
Since however <i>R<sub>1</sub> <= R<sub>2</sub></i>, we see that
<i>(p d<sub>2</sub> in R<sub>2</sub> </i>.

<p> Thus we have shown that any <i>p in D<sub>1</sub>->R<sub>1</sub></i>.
maps D<sub>2</sub> to R<sub>2</sub>, thus establishing our lemma.
<hr>

<p>
A consequence of the contravariance rule is that, for example, despite the
fact that  Integer<=Number, the type Integer->Integer is not contained
in the type Number->Number.   Thus the inteersection
<ul>
    (Integer->Integer) /\ (Number->Number)
</ul>
<p>
is non-redundant.


<p>
A simple converse of these two lemmas is clearly not true of all domains.
for consider a domain without procedure objects. Then D->R is always the
empty-set, so that D<sub>1</sub>->R<sub>1</sub><=D<sub>2</sub>->R<sub>2</sub> is true for any domains and ranges whatever.
So, discussion of the converse of these lemmas will have to wait until we have
established how richly populated our Procedure type needs to be.</p>

<h2>Finding the Type of an Expression</h2>

In this section we prove some results required to be able to infer the type
of an expression in a computational universe.


<h3> The Type of Shonfinkel Combinators. </h3>

Since the combinators are denizens of every universe, let's start with
their type. As might be expected for such general operators, anything one
can say about their type is universally quantified over one or more
type-variables.</p>

<hr>
<h4>Lemma</h4>

If T is a type, then <b>I</b>:T->T


<h4>Proof</h4>

<p>
Let t in T. Then <b>I</b> t = t. Thus <b>I</b> in T->T.

<hr>
<h4>Lemma</h4>

If T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> are types, then <b>K</b> in T<sub>1</sub>->T<sub>2</sub>->T<sub>1</sub>

<h4>Proof</h4>

Let t<sub>1</sub> in T<sub>1</sub>, consider (<b>K</b> t<sub>1</sub>). For all t<sub>2</sub> in T<sub>2</sub>, (<b>K</b> t<sub>1</sub>) t<sub>2</sub> = t<sub>1</sub>. Thus
(<b>K</b> t<sub>1</sub>) in T<sub>2</sub>->T<sub>1</sub>. Hence <b>K</b> in T<sub>1</sub>->(T<sub>2</sub>->T<sub>1</sub>)

<hr>

<h4>Lemma</h4>

If <i>T<sub>1</sub>,
T<sub>2</sub>, T'<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>3</sub></i> are types
of  a  universe  <i>U</i>  without  exceptions,  where
<i>T'<sub>2</sub> <= T<sub>2</sub></i>,
then
<b>S</b>   in
<i>(T<sub>1</sub>->T<sub>2</sub> -> T<sub>3</sub>) ->
(T<sub>1</sub>->T'<sub>2</sub>)  ->  T<sub>1</sub>   ->
T<sub>3</sub></i>

<h4>Proof</h4>

<p> It is sufficient to show that if <i>f</i> in
<i>T<sub>1</sub>->T<sub>2</sub>->T<sub>3</sub></i>
then <i>(<b>S</b> f)</i> in
<i>(T<sub>1</sub>->T'<sub>2</sub>)->T<sub>1</sub>->T<sub>3</sub></i>

<p> Hence it suffices to show that if, in addition,  <i>g</i> in
<i>T<sub>1</sub>->T'<sub>2</sub></i> then  <i>(<b>S</b> f g)</i>
in <i>T<sub>1</sub> -> T<sub>3</sub></i>.

<p> Hence it suffices to show that if, in addition,
<i>x</i> in  <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> then
<i> <b>S</b> f g x</i> in <i>T<sub>3</sub></i>.

<p>  But  <i><b>S</b>  f  g  x  =  (f  x)  (g  x)</i>.  Since  <i>x</i>  in
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i>,             and              <i>f</i>              in
<i>T<sub>1</sub>->T<sub>2</sub>->T<sub>3</sub></i>, it follows  that (f  x)
in T<sub>2</sub>->T<sub>3</sub>.  Likewise  (g  x)  in  T'<sub>2</sub>.
But
<i>T'<sub>2</sub><=T<sub>2</sub></i>,
so that <i>((f x) (g x))</i> in <i>T<sub>3</sub></i>. Hence
<i>(<b>S</b>  f   g   x)</i>  in   <i>T<sub>3</sub></i>,
hence  <i>(<b>S</b>   f   g)</i>   in
<i>T<sub>1</sub>->T<sub>3</sub></i>,
hence        <i>(<b>S</b>       f)</i>        in
<i>(T<sub>1</sub>->T'<sub>2</sub>)->T<sub>1</sub>->T<sub>3</sub></i>,
hence
<ul>
<b>S</b>
in
<i>(T<sub>1</sub>->T<sub>2</sub>->T<sub>3</sub>)->(T<sub>1</sub>->T'<sub>2
</sub>)->T<sub>1</sub>->T<sub>3</sub></i>
</ul>.

<p>
One interpretation of the above results is that a <em>particular</em> type
for one of the combinators is as an intersection. For example, for any two
types T1 and T2:

<ul>
   <b>I</b>
in (T<sub>1</sub> -> T<sub>1</sub>)/\( T<sub>2</sub> -> T<sub>2</sub>)
</ul>

<hr>
<h3> Finding the type of an application</h3>


<p>
The following lemma suggests how we can ascribe a type to a
function-application, where the function belongs to a type-intersection.

<h4>Lemma</h4>

Let <i>p</i> in
<i>D<sub>1</sub>->R<sub>1</sub> /\ D<sub>2</sub>->R<sub>2</sub>
...D<sub>n</sub>->R<sub>n</sub></i>.
Let <i>d</i> in <i>D<sub>1</sub> /\ D<sub>2</sub>..D<sub>n</sub></i>.
Then <i>(p d)</i> in <i>R<sub>1</sub>/\R<sub>2</sub>...R<sub>n</sub></i>.

<h4>Proof</h4>

<p>   For   all   i   of   1..n,    d   of   D<sub>i</sub>.   Now   p    of
D<sub>i</sub>->R<sub>i</sub>. Hence (p d) of R<sub>i</sub> for  all i
of 1..n.

<hr>

To apply this lemma, suppose we have an expression <i>(p x)</i> where
<i>p in
D<sub>1</sub>->R<sub>1</sub> /\ D<sub>2</sub>->R<sub>2</sub>
...D<sub>n</sub>->R<sub>n</sub></i>, and x in X, for some type X. Then
we choose a subsequence
<i>D<sub>j<sub>1</sub></sub>...D<sub>j<sub>k</sub></sub></i> of the
<i>D<sub>i</sub></i> for which
<i>X<=D<sub>j<sub>1</sub></sub>...<=D<sub>j<sub>k</sub></sub></i>. Then we
can infer that <i>(p x)</i> in
<i>R<sub>j<sub>1</sub></sub>...R<sub>j<sub>k</sub></sub></i>


<hr>

<p>From the covariance-contravariance lemma, we can readily infer the
following.


<h4>Lemma</h4>

(D<sub>1</sub>\/D<sub>2</sub>)     ->      (R<sub>1</sub>/\R<sub>2</sub>)
<=
(D<sub>1</sub>->R<sub>1</sub>)/\(D<sub>2</sub>->R<sub>2</sub>).


<h2> Particular Universes </h2>

A universe U is said to <em>have the integers embedded</em> if there is
a type Integer<=U for which

<ul>

    <p> There is an element 0 in <b>Integer</b>
    <p> There is an element 1 in <b>Integer</b>
    <p> There is an element + in

            (+ x y) = (+ y x)<br>
            (+ (+ x y) z) = (+ x (+ y z))
</ul>
    <p>  There is an element <i>negate</i> in
        <b>Integer</b>-><b>Integer</b> with the property that
        (+ (negate x) x)  = 0
    <p> There is an element * in
        <b>Integer</b>-><b>Integer</b>-><b>Integer</b>
        with the property that for
        all <i>x,y,z</i> in

<ul>
            (* 0 x) = 0 <br>
            (* 1 x) = x <br>
            (* x y) = (* y x)<br>
            (* (* x y) z) = (* x (* y z)) <br>
            (* x (+ y z)) = (+ (* x y) (* x z))
</ul>
     <p> For all <i>x,y,z</i> in <b>Integer</b>,
     <i> (* x y) = (* x z)</i> implies <i> y = z or x=0 </i>

     <p><b>Integer</b> is generated by <i>0,1,+,*,negate</i>

</ul>
<hr>

<p>Let us now consider the problem of embedding the rationals in a universe
which already has embedded  integers. We could go  about this in two  ways.
The rationals could be made disjoint from the integers (which would be  the
way it would be done in SML), or  they can be made to include the  integers
(as in Common Lisp, Scheme, POP-11, Mathematica).


A universe U is said to <em>have the rationals embedded</em> if there is
a type <b>Rational</b><=U for which

<ul>

    <p> There is an element 0 in <b>Rational</b>
    <p> There is an element 1 in <b>Rational</b>
    <p> There is an element + in
        <b>Rational</b>-><b>Rational</b>-><b>Rational</b>
        with the property that for
        all <i>x,y,z</i> in
        <b>Rational</b>
<ul>
            (+ 0 x) = x <br>
            (+ x y) = (+ y x)<br>
            (+ (+ x y) z) = (+ x (+ y z))
</ul>
    <p>  There is an element <i>negate</i> in
        <b>Rational</b>-><b>Rational</b> with the property that
        (+ (negate x) x)  = 0
    <p> There is an element * in
        <b>Rational</b>-><b>Rational</b>-><b>Rational</b>
        with the property that for
        all <i>x,y,z</i> in

            (* 1 x) = x <br>
            (* x y) = (* y x)<br>
            (* (* x y) z) = (* x (* y z)) <br>
            (* x (+ y z)) = (+ (* x y) (* x z))
</ul>

    <p> There is an element reciprocal in
        <b>Rational</b>-><b>Rational</b>-><b>MayFail(Rational,e_div)</b>
        with the property that for
        for all <i>x/=0</i> in <b>Rational</b>
         (* (reciprocal x) x) = 1

     <p><b>Rational</b> is generated by <i>0,1,+,*,negate,reciprocal</i>
     <p>There is no sequence <i>x<sub>0</sub>...x<sub>n</sub></i> for
        which  x<sub>0</sub> = 1 = x<sub>n</sub> and
        x<sub>i</sub> =  (* a x<sub>i-1</sub>), a/=0
</ul>
<hr>


We can regard a universe with the rationals embedded as also being a
universe with  the integers embedded, if we restrict ourselves to the
sub-universe generated by 0,1,+,*,negate.


<ul>
    + in <b>Integer</b>-><b>Integer</b>-><b>Integer</b> /\ <b>Rational</b>-><b>Rational</b>-><b>Rational</b><br>

<h2> The Hindley-Milner Type Universe </h2>

<h4>Definition</h4>
Let <b>T</b> be a finite set of entities called <em>concrete types</em>.
Let V be a countably infinite set of <em>type variables</em>.
Let <i>e</i> be an exception. Then a type-term is defined as
<ul>
<br>  If <i>T</i> in <b>T</b> then <i>T</i> is a type-term.
<br>  If <i>v</i> in <i>V</i> then <i>v</i> is a type-term.
<br>  e is a type-term
<br>  If <i>t<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>t<sub>2</sub></i> are type-terms,
      then <i>t<sub>1</sub> -> t<sub>2</sub></i> is a type-term.
</ul>

<h4>Definition</h4>
We say that two type-terms <i>t<sub>1</sub></i> and  <i>t<sub>2</sub></i>
are type-equivalent if the most-general-unifier
<ul>
<i>mgu (<i>t<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>t<sub>2</sub></i>)</i>
</ul>is a permutation of type-variables.

<p> Clearly the concept of type-equivalence defined above is an equivalence
relation.

<h4>Definition</h4>
If <b>T</b> is a set of base-types, and <i>V</i> is a countably infinite
set of type variables, then the Hindley-Milner Universe is the set of
equivalence classes of type-terms under type  equivalence. As before, we
will denote the equivalence class corresponding to a term <i>t</i> by
<i>t'</i>.

<p>
Clearly, if we have two members u1,u2 of a Hindley-Milner Universe  U, we
can choose two terms t1,t2 with distinct type variables such that u1 = t1'
and u2 = t2'.

<h4>Definition</h4>
If <i>u<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>u<sub>2</sub></i> are members of
<i>HM(<b>T</b>,V)</i> then the application
<i>(u<sub>1</sub> u<sub>2</sub></i>)
is defined as follows
<ul>
If   u<sub>1</sub> = (t<sub>D</sub> -> t<sub>R</sub>)'
and  u<sub>2</sub> = t<sub>2</sub>'
where the type-variables of <i>t<sub>2</sub></i> are distinct from those
of t_D and t_R,
and  s = mgu(t<sub>D</sub>,t<sub>2</sub>)
then
<i>(u<sub>1</sub> u<sub>2</sub>) = (s(t<sub>R</sub>))' </i>
<br>
Otherwise
<i>(u<sub>1</sub> u<sub>2</sub>) = e </i>

</ul>

<h4>Lemma</h4>
With the above definition of application, the
Hindley-Milner Universe U=HM(<b>T</b>,V,e) is a computational universe
with exception {e}

<h4>Proof</h4>

<ul>  <p>well-defined....

<p>
Consider  (v1->v2->v1)' in U, where v1,v2 are distinct type-variables.
Let t1' t2' in U with type-variables
distinct from v1,v2.  Then
<ul>
(v1->v2->v1)' t1' t2' =  ((v1->(v2->v1))' t1') t2'<br>

= (v2 -> t1)' t2' ----------------------- with mgu(v1,t1) = [v1.t1]  <br>
 = t1'------------------------------- with mgu(v2,t2) = [v2.t2].
</ul>
So, if we set <b>K</b> = (v1->v2->v1)', the K-axiom is satisfied.


<p>
Consider S = ((v1->v2->v3) -> (v1->v2) -> v1 -> v3)'
Let  f', g' and x' be in U.
<br>   If sf = mgu(f,(v1->v2->v3) then  (S f) = (sf((v1->v2) -> v2->v3))'
<br>   if sg = mgu(g,sf(v1->v2)) then   (S f g) = (sg (v1->v3))'
<br>   if sx = mgu(x,sg(v1))  then (S f g x) = (sx(v3))'
<br>  Otherwise, if any of the most-general-unifiers does not exist,
(S f g x) in E.


<p>Now consider ((f' x') (g' x')).
f = sf(v1->v2->v3), x = sx(sg((v1))


If this does not evaluate to e, then
there exist  t_D and t_R for which
  (f' x') = (t_D -> t_R)'
  s = mgu(t_D,g)

Consider the expression

<ul>
     S(S (K +) (K 3)) I
</ul>
for any x

     S(S (K +) (K 3)) I x    =  (S (K +) (K 3) x) (I x)
    =  ((K +) x)  ((K 3) x)  x
    =   (+ 3 x)

That is S(S (K +) (K 3)) I   is the function "add 3". How can we type this?

     (K +) has the type   T1 -> (Z->Z->Z/\Q->Q->Q)
     (K 3) has the type   T2 -> Z






For any types T<sub>1</sub>,T<sub>2</sub>

cons : T<sub>1</sub> -> T<sub>2</sub> -> Prod(T<sub>1</sub>,T<sub>2</sub>)
front: Prod(T<sub>1</sub>,T<sub>2</sub>) -> T<sub>1</sub>
back :  Prod(T<sub>1</sub>,T<sub>2</sub>) -> T<sub>2</sub>







<h2> Terms and their Denotation </h2>

<p>
In this section we will show how we can characterise any computation as
<em>evaluating</em> an expression in the Universe. An expression can consist
of

<ul>
<li>
    a variable    v
<li>
    an abstraction  \v.e
<li>
    an application   (e1 e2)
</ul>

<p>
Now one question arises "what does a variable standing by itself mean?".
Generally, we think of variables as standing for something else. It is
reasonable therefore to require our expressions to contain only bound
variables.

<p>
First let us consider abstractions. We would like the abstraction

    \x.(+ x 3)

<p>
to "mean" the function "add 3". so that

    (\x.(+ x 3) 7)   ==> 10


<p>
Thus we get to understanding the meaning of the application
of a lambda-abstraction to arguments in terms of <em>substitution</em>.
However we shall adopt a different approach here, motivated by the fact that
the concept of a <em>variable</em> and its scope can be tricky to handle.

<p>
We define a denotation mapping from Universe->Universe as

    Den[(\v.v)]   =  <b>I</b>
    Den[(\v.u)]   =  (E `free variable`)
    Den[(\v.c)]   =  <b>K</b> c
    Den[(e1 e2)]  =  (<b>S</b> Den[e1] Den[e2])








<p>
Any object O in Universe can play the role of being a <em>term</em>.
Let us define a <em>denotation function</em> Den:Universe->Universe as
follows:

Den(\x.x) = <b>I</b>
Den(\x.c) = <b>K</b> c
Den(\x. e1 e2) = <b>S</b> (Den e1) (Den e2)


<h4>Lemma</h4>

If D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>1</sub>,  R<sub>2</sub> are types,  and
D<sub>1</sub>  is   a  recognisable   type,   with  recogniser   is_D1,   then
D<sub>1</sub>->R<sub>1</sub>     <=      D<sub>2</sub>->R<sub>2</sub>      ==>
D<sub>2</sub><=D<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>1</sub><=R<sub>1</sub>.

<h4>Proof</h4>. Suppose D<sub>2</sub> is  not included in D<sub>1</sub>.  Then
there is a d<sub>2</sub> in D<sub>2</sub>, d<sub>2</sub> not in D<sub>1</sub>.
Consider f = \x. if (is_D1 x) instance(D<sub>1</sub>)






<h2>Environments and Evaluation.</h2>


<p>
An environment is a representation of a finite mapping from symbols to
objects.

<pre>
Eval (f a) e =
    Apply((Eval f e)  (Eval a e)


Eval (if x y z) e = if (Eval x e) then (Eval y e) else (Eval z e)

Eval c  = c

Eval (\x. t)  e  = (Closure x t e)

Eval (Closure x t e) = (Closure x t e)

Eval (quote t) e = t


Apply p x e                   = PrimApply p x
Apply (Closure x t<sub>1</sub> e1) t<sub>2</sub> e2 = Eval t<sub>1</sub>  e1[x|t<sub>2</sub>]

<h2> Type Universes </h2>


NO! this screws up


<p>


    Universe(A,B)

This universe is  created
from a certain  set of <em>base  objects</em> by repeated  use of a  single
function, <em>Apply</em>.



The universe contains at least the following <em>base objects</em>


<ul>
<li>  There is a zero object 0.
<li>  There is an object 1.
<li>  There is a "null object", denoted by []
<li>  There is a "false object", denoted by false
<li>  There is a "true object", denoted by true.
</ul>


In particular there are the following <em>base types</em>


<ul>
<li> <tt>Boolean</tt>. This consists of the two objects  true and false

<li> Null       This consists of the single object, [].

<li> Procedure  Procedures provide the way of building our infinite universe.
                If p is a procedure, and x is an object of the Universe, then
                Apply p x is another object.

<li> Exception  An exception is the result of a "failed" application of a
                procedure. If e is an exception, then, for any object x
                (x e) is an exception, as is (e x).

<li> Integer

<li> Ratio

<li> Float

<li> Pair

<li> Symbol

<li> CompoundTerm


A type  T is a subset  T<=Universe.

<li> LambdaAbstraction

<li> Theorem

</ul>

In addition to the base-types, we shall refer to
the following <em>composite types</em>.

<ul>
<li> <b>Rational</b> = Integer <b>\/</b>  Ratio
<li> Number =  <b>Rational</b> \/ Float
</ul>

<p>
These base-types are mutually exclusive - any object belongs to at most one
base-type.

<h4> The MayBe and CouldBe type constructors.</h4>
Let T <= Universe be a type of which false is not a member. Then MayBe(T)
denotes the type<br> T \/ {false}

<p>
Integer <b>><</b> Real



<pre>
    /  : <b>Rational</b>-><b>Rational</b>->CouldBe(<b>Rational</b>)
</pre>

<p>
Let T <= Universe be a type. Then CouldBe(T)
denotes the type T\/Exception.
