<p>
Normal order reduction will perform reductions both inside and outside
<img src=lambda.gif> abstractions. If we wish to regard reduction as a model of
computation then only reductions outside of <img src=lambda.gif> abstractions can be
regarded as corresponding to <em> running a program</em>. Reductions inside a
<img src=lambda.gif>-abstraction
are in effect manipulating program, something that is
usually done by a compiler. Thus we introduce the ideas of <em> weak normal
order reduction</em> and <em> weak normal form</em> in which the only reductions
performed are performed outside of any <em><img src=lambda.gif></em>-abstraction. This is also
called <em> call by name</em>, and is <em> safe</em> in the sense that if a
weak normal form exists, weak normal order reduction will find it.

<p>
Recall that normal order reduction takes the leftmost outermost redex. An
alternative strategy is to take the <em> leftmost innermost redex</em>. This is
<em> call by value</em> and is <em> unsafe</em> in the sense that an infinite
sequence of reductions may arise despite the fact that a (weak) normal form
exists.

<p>
Nevertheless most languages use some kind of call by value for almost all
reductions because it is easier to implement efficiently than call by name
(call by reference does not really make sense from the functional point of
view).

<h2>Strictness and Laziness</h2>
A function is said to be <em> strict</em> if it is certain to need the value of
its argument. The <em>sin</em>
function for example is strict. The conditional
function <em>if</em> is non-strict, since evaluating the expression
<em>if E<sub>1</sub> E<sub>2</sub> E<sub>3</sub></em> can be performed without evaluating both <em>E<sub>2</sub></em> and
<em>E<sub>3</sub></em>.  Indeed it would be impossible to write recursive functions without
some laziness around.



<h2>Semantics</h2>

Our <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus is a fine edifice, but is it sound?  A mathematician looking at it
for the first time would be reminded of a sad little story of the beginning
of the 20th century: the mathematician Frege had built an elegant
theory of sets; Unfortunately it was inconsistent - that is to say it had
no meaning, and was torpedoed and sunk by Bertrand Russell.

The problem with this set theory was that it allowed expressions of the
form <em>x\in x</em>,
and in particular allowed the formalism <em>{x|x<img src=not_in.gif> x}</em>
- `the set of all sets which are not members of themselves'. Consider
<em>{x|x<img src=not_in.gif> x}\in{x|x<img src=not_in.gif> x}</em>. To give a meaning to this, we must
assign the value <em>TRUE</em> or the value <em>FALSE</em> to it. But in either case we
have a contradiction.

There is a  horrid formal resemblance  to <em><img src=lambda.gif> x.xx</em>,  and to  <em><img src=lambda.gif>
x.xx<img src=lambda.gif> x.xx</em> which is allowed in  the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus, and a nasty suspicion  must
arise in the  mathematical mind  that it might  not be  possible to  give a
`sensible' meaning to the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus in which the common-sense view of
<img src=lambda.gif>-
expressions as <em> functions</em> can be substantiated.

<h3>Mending logic: Types and ZF-Set Theory</h3>

Fortunately for mathematics, set-theory was mended, and in two ways:
<ul>
<li>Russell and Whitehead developed a <em> theory of types</em> which ruled
out forms such as <em>x</em>in<em> x</em>
by treating it as <em> not well typed</em>. From
this theory has developed, with more or less precision, the whole idea of
<em> type</em> in programming languages.
<li> Zermelo and Frankel developed a set theory in which restricted the
problematic <em>{x|P(x)}</em> by requiring that the property <em>P</em> only be used to
choose members of a set constructed by other means <em> constructed here is
a relative term</em>. Thus the only allowed form is <em>{x|x\in S and P(x)}</em>,
where <em>S</em> is constructed by operations such as cartesian product or
power set.
</ul>

<p>
Russell and Whitehead's approach would require us to have a <em> typed</em>
<img src=lambda.gif>-calculus. Such a edifice can be built, and is indeed a very desirable mansion
that actual programming languages may inhabit. However that elegant
creature the <em>Y</em> combinator cannot dwell therein.

<p>
But it is not mathematically necessary to have a typed <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus: it was shown in
1969 by Scott and Strachey that it is possible to devise an interpretation
of the untyped <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus in ZF set theory.




Answer:
<ul>
YE = (<img src=lambda.gif> h.
         (<img src=lambda.gif> x.h (x x)) (<img src=lambda.gif> x.h (x x)))
         E <br>
 =  (<img src=lambda.gif> x.E (x x)) (<img src=lambda.gif> x.E (x x))<br>
 =  (E (<img src=lambda.gif> x.E (x x) <img src=lambda.gif> x.E (x x)))<br>
 =  E (YE)
</ul>

<li>a countably infinite alphabet of variables,
<em>u... z, u<sub>1</sub> ... z<sub>1</sub>, ... u<sub>n</sub> ... z<sub>n</sub>, ... </em>
(It is of course only for human convenience that we allow distinct letters
of the alphabet, formally and computationally we could use one sequence
<em>v<sub>1</sub>...</em>)



<h2> The <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus with Constants, Primitives </h2>
<p>To make the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus suitable as a basis for
practical computation we need to introduce entities which correspond to the
capabilities of a real computer on which  a program will run.

<p>
A minimal capability would be provided by


<ul>
<li> The natural numbers: 0,1,2,3,4...
<li> Two boolean constants <em>true</em>    and <em>false</em>
<li> Arithmetic operations <em>+, -, * </em>
<li> A conditional function  <em>if</em> for which the meaning of
     <em>(if E E<sub>1</sub>E<sub>2</sub>)</em> is the same as the

</ul>

<p>
with the property that
     <em>(if true E<sub>1</sub>E<sub>2</sub>)</em>
     evaluates to E<sub>1</sub>, and
     <em>(if false E<sub>1</sub>E<sub>2</sub>)</em>
     evaluates to E<sub>2</sub>, and





<h2>When are two expressions in <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus `equal'?</h2>

<p>In secondary school we learned that expressions can be ``worked out'' or
evaluated, by substitution and arithmetic. Thus <em>x+2</em>, with <em>x=4</em>,
evaluates to <em>6</em>. <img src=beta.gif>-
and </em><img src=delta.gif></em>- reduction play the `working out'
role for <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus. However we also learned ways of determining that two
expressions were <em> identically equal</em>. Thus  <em>x+2</em> and <em>2+x</em> are
identically equal in school algebra. In this section we want to examine the
question `can we say whether two expressions in the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus are equal?'.

<h3><img src=lambda.gif></em> calculus expressions denote functions</h3>

<p>
In school algebra the symbols stand for numbers. In the  <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus
they stand for, or as we say <em> denote</em>, functions (and other entities as
well if we have added constants to make our <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus impure). It turns out to be
non-trivial to develop a theory of denotation for the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus - it took
mathematicians nearly 30 years to come up with a satisfactory one, which we
will not discuss here. However we will use some informal ideas of
denotation in our discussion.

<p>
For example we may say that <em><img src=lambda.gif> x. +  x  3</em> denotes the
function `add 3', which is commonly regarded formally as the infinite set
<em>{... (-4,-1), (-3,0), (-2,1),(-1,2),(0,3),(1,4)...}</em> of pairs of
integers - you might think of it as a graph drawn on an infinite piece of
graph paper.

<p>
Thus we will discuss, informally, some rules that allow us to say that two
expressions in the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus always denote the same thing.

<h3>We can't always decide equality</h3>

<p>
The <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus is a powerful formalism, capable of expressing any computation. We
know we can't <em> decide</em> whether two programs perform the same
computation, so we should not expect to be able to <em> decide</em> whether two
<img src=lambda.gif>-calculus expressions are equal - we may be able to say `yes for sure', `no for
sure', or `I can't tell'.


<h3><img src=beta.gif></em>-conversion and equality</h3>

<p>
The <em><img src=beta.gif></em>-reduction rule that we have already met can also be used as a
equality inference rule - in both directions.
