<p>Computer
Systems  generally inhabit  a  less challenging  environment  than
bridges do, so one might reasonably  expect that they would fall down  less
often. The central challenge  of Computer Science is  that the contrary  is
the case. Experience  in other engineering  disciplines would suggest  that
what is required  is the  specification and  construction of  computational
systems within a framework that supports analysis.

<p>Given
the need  for computational  systems to be  analysable, the  question
arises "how to  strike a  balance between what  is analysable  and what  is
practicable". For example, a  vast corpus of material  is written in  the C
language which supports  analysis very  poorly indeed; however C has proved
to be a practical basis for the construction of systems at an early stage
in the development of our discipline.

<p>In this  seminar,  by contrast  with  C, we  will  look at  one
particular
approach to creating software which makes analysability central, namely the
Functional approach to Programming Language Design. This approach is based
on desigining languages which have a close formal relation to the <img
src=lambda.gif>-calculus.



<p> So, to elaborate, we will:

<ul>
<li> Study the theory of functional languages, including the concept of
     data-type. Consider the application of this theory in the realm
     of object-oriented languages.
<li> Develop the design of a simple but powerful functional language.
<li> Design an implementation of this language using as target-architecture
     the Java Virtual Machine.
<li> Study and implement proof-methods which will allow us to verify the
     correctness of programs.
</ul>



<p> Generally the application of computers to engineering design is
somewhat ahead of their application to software design. In particular it is
common for engineers to use a tool such as Mathematica or Maple to
assist in
performing an analysis of the behaviour of a system before it is
implemented. In this seminar we'd like to explore how functional languages
can be used to address this gap by supporting detailed mathematical
analysis of program behaviour.

<p> In implementing programs it is common enough to employ what might be
called "macroscopic" tools to analyse the behaviour of a program at a
rather coarse level of detail. The most widely used such tool is the
concept of <em>data type</em> which is built into most programming
languages. Type-analysis will tell you that <tt> x+"fred" </tt> is an
illegal expression (in most languages) because you can't add a number to a
string. It won't tell you that you have made an error if you have
written <tt>x+1</tt> when you  meant <tt>x-1</tt>.

<p> On the other hand, Mathematica can tell you precisely that - for
example if you want a solution of the equation <em>x<sup>2</sup>+2x+1</em>,
Mathematica can determine that <em>x=1</em> is not a solution of that
equation (or of course it can solve the equation for you).

<p>But computer programs in general are opaque to the sort of analysis that
Mathematica and Maple can perform.
Before we can even begin to prove that a program is correct, we have to
characterise the behaviour of the programming language in which the program
is written. Functional programming languages are characterised in a
particularly simple way: every component of a program is treated as a
<em>mathematical function</em> whose meaning follows the simple
rule that <em>within a given context</em> identical expressions have
identical values.

<p>To give an example of what we mean, in a pure functional language a
mathematical identity like:

<pre>
         fred(x) + fred(x) = 2*fred(x)
</pre>

should hold.  This  is  not  necessarily  the  case  for  a  non-functional
language, for example  in Pascal or  C <tt>fred</tt> might  be a  procedure
which had a side-effect,  so that calling it  twice has a different  effect
from  calling  it  once.  For  example  <tt>fred</tt>  might  contain   the
assignment <tt>g:=g+1</tt>  where  <tt>g</tt>  is a  global  variable. Thus
the value of <tt>fred(x)</tt> varies with the number of times it has been
evaluated.


<a name="lambda"></a>
<h2>The Lambda Calculus Provides our Basic Formalism</h2>

<p>If  you  ask   a  mathematician   "what,  fundamentally,   <em>is</em> a
function", he is likely  to talk about  a set of  <em>(argument,value)</em>
pairs. He  may well  characterise the  relationship between  arguments  and
values in some way that he regards as adequate, without any guarantee  that
there is any way, given an argument, of computing the corresponding  value.
For example, mathematicians  can (and  do) speak of  a function  <em>f</em>
defined on the real  numbers for which  <em>f(x)=0</em> when <em>x</em>  is
rational, and <em>f(x)=1</em> when <em>x</em> is irrational. But any
attempt to implement such a function computationally would require us to
solve undecidable problems.

<p><small>[Note
that, while some programming languages
refer to floating-point numbers as "real" numbers, they are in fact only
crude approximations, quite inadequate for representing this particular
function <em>f</em>.

<p>An accurate representation of reals would require a given real to
be represented as an infinite sequence of rationals. One can only
implement such a thing computationally as a program, so that deciding
if a particular real, so represented, is equivalent to a rational, is
about proving whether the program that represents the real produces the
same output as a program that produces a constant rational. This is an
instance of a class of problems known to be undecidable.
]</small>

<p>This kind of approach  is fine for mathematicians,  who are usually  not
too concerned  about  whether  they  can  actually  <em>construct</em>  the
entities  of  which  they  speak.  As  computer  scientists  we  need  some
mathematical way of characterising functions which, as a formalism,  guides
us exactly into something we can realise as a computation.


<p>The generally agreed solution to this requirement of constructability of
functions   is    to    use   as    our    basic   formalism    the    <img
src=lambda.gif>-calculus, invented  by Church,  the American  logician,
<em>circa</em>
1940. It  was  developed as  a  branch  of mathematics,  rather  than  as a
programming language (antedating all  programming languages), and was  thus
defined essentially as marks on a piece of paper. However it is very easily
represented in a computer. The <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus is capable  of
expressing any computation,  like a  Turing machine, but,  unlike a  Turing
machine, it  can  be  made  the basis  of  elegant  and  powerful  computer
languages.


<p>
One of the conceptual problems that beginners in formal logic, and
the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus is a formal logic, face is the `bootstrapping conundrum', namely
that we are trying to build a very formal system using our less formal
ideas of ordinary mathematics, which were, in our teens, build using the
even less formal ideas expressible in natural language. There is probably
little that can be said except to point out that there is a computational
analogy - if for example we want to build a super-secure computer system,
it will depend on using less-secure tools, and ultimately on hand-crafted
machine code which is not secure at all. Nevertheless, by careful checking
and cross checking, and incorporating tests for consistency, we can build
systems in which we trust.

<a name = "expressions"></a>
<h3>Expressions in the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus </h3>

<p> Most programming languages have a quite complex syntax that can take
days or even weeks to learn. The <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus has an
exceedingly simple syntax.  The syntactic definition given below is
intended to emphasise the role of the  <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus as a
basis for programming languages. We use a bold font for non-terminal
symbols of the syntax (for example <b>E<sub>1</sub></b>).

<p>
The <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus consists of a set of
<em>expressions</em>.
<ul>

<li>
    <p>A countably infinite set of variables. We shall use as variables
    any sequence of letters, digits or the "_" character which begins
    with a letter, or any sequence of the "sign" characters,

<ul> + - * / < > = ~ # $ % ^ & ~ ? |
</ul>
    However certain sequences which would be variables
    are <em>reserved</em>. For our purposes these are:
    <ul> true  false System
    </ul> </p>

<li> <p>A set of constants.  In our case these will be
    <ul>
    <li> The natural numbers, <b>NatNum</b>, namely<br>
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11...
    <li> The boolean constants <em>true</em> and <em>false</em>
    <li> If  <b>E</b> is an expression, then it can be quoted
         to give a constant  '<b>E</b>'.
    <li> The constant <em>System</em>.
    </ul>
    </p>

<li><p> If <b>E<sub>1</sub></b> and <b>E<sub>2</sub></b> are expressions of
the  <img  src=lambda.gif>-calculus,   then  the  <em>application</em>   of
<b>E<sub>1</sub></b>      to      <b>E<sub>2</sub></b>      is      written
(<b>E<sub>1</sub>E<sub>2</sub></b>), and is an expression.</p>

<li>  <p><img src=lambda.gif>-abstraction:
If <b>v</b> is a variable, and <b>E</b> is an expression
of the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus, then the </em>abstraction</em>
<b><img src=lambda.gif> v. E</b> is an expression of the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus.
The expression <b>E</b> is referred to as the <em>body</em> of the
abstraction <b><img src=lambda.gif> v.E</b>
</p>
</ul>

<p>Basically, that's it! We can begin to give some <em>meaning</em> to this
syntax, providing some explanation of what a given expression
<em>denotes</em>. Doing this systematically will take quite a bit of work,
but roughly we can say:

<ul>

<li><p>A variable <em>v</em> is a <em>symbol</em> which (eventually) has an
associated <em>value</em>. Variables in the  <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus
play much the same role as identifiers in a programming language. We'll see
exactly how quite shortly, when we talk about <img src=beta.gif>-reduction.
</p>

<li> <p>Among the constants, the natural numbers are self-explanatory -
a given sequence of  characters such as <em>123</em>  denote a  natural
number,   using    the   base-10    convention.   Note    however    that a
maximally-faithful    computational    representation    of    the     <img
src=lambda.gif>-calculus will require us to use <em>arbitrary precision
arithmetic</em> so that the only limit on the size of a natural number will
be the storage capacity of the machine.</p>

<p>The boolean constants should also be self-explanatory.</p>

<p>The <em>System</em> constant serves to provide an interface to the
built-in capabilities of the computer and its software. For example,
the expression <em>(System '+')</em> evaluates to a function which performs
addition. Don't be alarmed about the cumbersome nature of this - normally
we make sure that the value of the variable <em>+</em> is bound to
<em>(System '+')</em>.
</p>

<p>The purpose of quoted expressions is to support the ability to mechanise
reasoning about the  <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus within the  <img
src=lambda.gif> calculus itself.</p>

<li><p>An application (<em>E<sub>1</sub>E<sub>2</sub></em>) can be  thought
of as meaning  "apply the function  <em>E<sub>1</sub></em> to the  argument
<em>E<sub>2</sub></em>",  as,  for  example,  we  may  apply  the  function
<b>sin</b>  to  the  argument  <em>0</em>  when  we  write  the  expression
<b>sin</b><em> 0</em> in mathematics.  Likewise, in the  <img
src=lambda.gif>-calculus, if the variable
<em>abs</em> has as its value the absolute-value-function, then
<em>(abs x)</em> denotes the absolute value of the value denoted by the
variable <em>x</em>. </p>

<p> But, you may say, most people want to have functions that take more
than one argument - how is this accomplished? Let's consider addition, and
in a context in which the variable <em>+</em> denotes addition.
The sum of two natural numbers <em>5</em> and <em>3</em> can be expressed
as <em>((+ 5) 3)</em> - we understand this as meaning that the expression
<em>(+ 5)</em> evaluates to a <em>function</em> we can call "add 5". This
function is then applied to <em>3</em>, obtaining <em>8</em>.
</p>


<a name = "eta">
<li><p>An abstraction <em><img src=lambda.gif> v.E</em> can be thought of
as meaning "that function which maps the variable <em>v</em> to the
expression <em>E</em>. Remember that <em>E</em> is an expression, in which
<em>v</em> may, and usually will, occur.
For example, <em><img src=lambda.gif> v.v</em> means "that function which
maps <em>v</em> to itself", that is to say, the identity function.
Likewise, in a context in which <em>+</em> denotes addition, the expression
<br><em>
<img src=lambda.gif>x.((+ 5) x) </em> means "that function which maps
<em>x</em> to <em>5+x</em>", that is the function "add 5".  Note that we
have  already encountered this "add 5" function in a different form above.
We shall address  the issue of what it means for these two expressions to
denote the same function when we consider the <em><img
src="eta.gif">-equivalence</em>
rule below.

</ul>


<p>As defined above, complex expressions in the  <img
src=lambda.gif>-calculus would have a great many parentheses. To avoid
the confusion to the human reader that all these parentheses create,
it is  conventional to  write an expression of the form

<ul>
(...(((<b>E<sub>1</sub> E<sub>2</sub></b>)
<b>E<sub>3</sub></b>)... <b>E<sub>n</sub></b>)
</ul>
as <em>(<b>E<sub>1</sub> E<sub>2</sub> E<sub>3</sub>...
E<sub>n</sub></b>)</em>

and to write <em>(<img src=lambda.gif>
v.(<b>E<sub>1</sub>E<sub>2</sub>...E<sub>n</sub></b>))</em>
as <em>(<img src=lambda.gif> v.<b>E<sub>1</sub>
E<sub>2</sub>...E<sub>n</sub></b></em>),
or even to
omit the outer parentheses if that can be done without ambiguity.
The
convention about the syntactic scope of a <img src=lambda.gif>-abstraction
is that it extends as far to the right as possible. Thus

 <ul><img src=lambda.gif> v.E<sub>1</sub>
E<sub>2</sub>...E<sub>n</sub></ul>

means

 <ul>(<img src=lambda.gif> v.E<sub>1</sub>
E<sub>2</sub>...E<sub>n</sub>)</ul>

and not

 <ul>(<img src=lambda.gif> v.E<sub>1</sub>)
E<sub>2</sub>...E<sub>n</sub></ul>

<p>Note that application is <em> not</em> an associative operation, so that
 <b>E<sub>1</sub></b> (<b>E<sub>2</sub> E<sub>3</sub></b>)  is not the
same as
 <br> (<b>E<sub>1</sub> E<sub>2</sub></b>)<b> E<sub>3</sub></b>. Note also
that in the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus every function takes exactly  one
argument, which  is why  the  basic form  of  the abstraction  is  <em><img
src=lambda.gif> v.E</em>,  with  just  one  variable  <em>v</em>.  However,
provided we remember this fact, it is syntactically convenient to write

<ul><img src=lambda.gif> v<sub>1</sub> v<sub>2</sub> . E
</ul>

to mean

<ul><img   src=lambda.gif>    v<sub>1</sub>   .    <img    src=lambda.gif>
v<sub>2</sub> . E
</ul>

and similarly for more variables.

<a name="lisp"></a>
<h3>LISP and the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus</h3>

<p> A word of warning is needed  here to readers who are familiar with  the
LISP language, or any derivative such as Scheme: It would appear that  LISP
was inspired by the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus, but is certainly not  an
exact implementation of  it, despite the  significant syntactic
similarity. Thus  the  LISP  S-expression  <em>(u  v  w)</em>  does  not
mean  ``apply <em>u</em> to <em>v</em>  and then apply  the result to
<em>w</em>, as  it would in the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus.


<p>However more modern functional languages which on the surface appear
more remote from the  <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus, are in fact much
closer. For example the SML expression:

<pre>
    fn x=> x*x;
</pre>

is quite a faithful representation of the  <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus
expression  <em><img src=lambda.gif> x. (* x x)</em>.

<a name = "beta">
<h3><img src=beta.gif>-reduction: Our Basic Computation Mechanism</h3></a>

<p>Above we stated that the abstraction
<em><img src=lambda.gif> v.<b>E</b></em>
could be understood as meaning "that function which maps the variable
<em>v</em> to the expression <em>E</em>".
We can give a practical meaning to this statement by defining exactly what
it means to apply a <img src=lambda.gif>-expression to an argument.
Consider the application
<p><ul>((<img    src=lambda.gif> x. (+ 5 x)) 22)</ul>

<p>We've said that
<em><img src=lambda.gif> x. (+ 5 x) </em> means "that function which maps
x to (+ 5 x)". So, if we give it an argument <em>22</em> we should expect
to get <em>(+ 5 22)</em> as the result. That is to say, we have
substituted <em>22</em> for <em>x</em> in the body of the <img
src=lambda.gif> expression. </p>

<p> To make this precise we have to define what we mean by
<em>substitution</em>. We need a little notation first. We'll say that

<ul>
<b>E<sub>1</sub></b>[<b>x</b>:=E<sub>2</sub></b>]
</ul>

means "the expression <b>E<sub>1</sub></b> with <b>E<sub>2</sub></b>
substituted for <b>x</b>". Roughly what this means is "go through the
expression <b>E<sub>1</sub></b> and replace every occurrence of <b>x</b>
by <b>E<sub>2</sub></b>".  However substitution is not quite as simple as
that. For example the variable <b>x</b> might be used (or as
we say <em>rebound</em>) in a <img    src=lambda.gif>-abstraction occurring
inside <b>E<sub>1</sub></b>; this isn't the only complication. We'll defer
the full definition of substitution until later.

<p> The process of converting the application of a <img src=lambda.gif>
-abstraction to an argument by substituting the argument for the variable
of the abstraction in the body of the abstraction is called "<img
src=beta.gif>-reduction".  We write
<ul>
    (<img src=lambda.gif> <b>x.E<sub>1</sub></b>)<b>E<sub>2</sub></b>
    <img src=longrightarrow.gif><sub><img src=beta.gif></sub>&#160
    <b>E<sub>1</sub></b>[<b>x</b>:=E<sub>2</sub></b>]
</ul>



<p>
For example, <em>(<img src=lambda.gif> x. (+ 5 x)) (+ 2 3)
    <img src=longrightarrow.gif><sub><img src=beta.gif></sub>&#160
(+ 5 (+ 2 3))</em>

<p>
There is no requirement that the <em>argument</em> of the application
should be "worked out" before a <img src=beta.gif>-reduction is done. So,
in the above example, we don't work-out that <em>(+ 2 3)</em> is <em>5</em>
before doing the <img src=beta.gif>-reduction - indeed such "working out"
is treated by another mechanism, <img src=delta.gif>-reduction, discussed
later.


<a name = "pure"></a>
<h3> The Pure Lambda Calculus </h3>


<p> If we take the  <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus as specified above and
throw out the constants, we obtain the <em>pure</em>
<img src=lambda.gif>-calculus</em>. It turns out that the pure calculus is
theoretically adequate to specify any computation in much the same sense
that a Turing machine is adequate. This is achieved by using <img
src=beta.gif>-reduction successively to transform a computation expressed
as an expression of the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus into another
expression which is the result of the computation.

<p>
Mathematicians, who as a class have swallowed Occam's razor hook  line
and sinker, may be  satisfied with  the pure  calculus. [<small>The  author
trusts   that   his   mixed   metaphors   will   not   give   his   readers
indigestion.</small>]
However, as a model  for practical computation, it  is
inadequate. In the pure calculus, for example, one can represent the number
3 as a <img src=lambda.gif>-abstraction
<em><img src=lambda.gif> f x. f(f(f(x)))</em>.


This is  similar  to the  use  of the  Peano  postulates in  your  Discrete
Mathematics course  to do  arithmetic.  You'll remember  that  2+1 =  3  is
rendered as:
<ul>
    succ(succ(0)) + succ(0) = succ(succ(succ(0)))
</ul>

Neither is much help if we want to calculate our income tax! However, since
the pure calculus is nice and simple, we'll make some use of it in our
theoretical discussions.





<a name = "functional"></a>
<h2>Functional languages and the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus</h2>

<p>The
<img src=lambda.gif>-calculus serves as a mathematical specification
for the design of functional programming languages. However, design of an
actual language gives rise to complications, syntactic and semantic. The
syntactic complications serve one main purpose, namely to assist human
comprehension of a program written in a language. We have already seen two
such concessions to human frailty in the suppression of unnecessary
parentheses and <img src=lambda.gif>'s.

<p> Another feature of programming languages that is something of a
historical accident is that a program is usually composed using only ASCII
characters.

<p>Within the constraint of using ASCII, most functional languages make
further concessions to perceived human need by adopting syntactic
conventions that approximate to normal mathematical usage. For example
most functional languages will allow the user to render:

<pre>
    (+ u (* v w))
</pre>
as
<pre>
    u + v*w
</pre>

<p>Provided that it is a translation of such syntax back to the <img
src=lambda.gif>-calculus
is rigorously defined, there is no objection to its use.

<p>There are a number of conventions for rendering <img
src=lambda.gif>-abstractions in ASCII. The one we will prefer is that used
in Haskell. The abstraction <em><img src=lambda.gif><b>v.E</b></em>
is rendered
in ASCII as <tt> \v.<b>E</b> </tt> where <tt><b>E</b></tt>
is the rendering of
<em><b>E</b></em>.
For example our old friend <em><img src=lambda.gif> x. (+ 5
x)</em> is rendered as

<pre>      \x. 5+x</pre>


<h4> How do we do "permanent" definitions? </h4>
One feature of the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus that might seem to be an
occasion of distress is that there is no apparent way of creating named
procedures as we can in most programming languages. For example in C
we can write:

<pre>
int f(int i) {return(5+i);}
</pre>

creating a procedure named "f" that we can use elsewhere in our progam.
Actually, we <em>can</em> do this kind of thing in the <img src=lambda.gif>
calculus, but in a rather inside-out kind of way. Suppose we wanted to use
the C function defined above to compute  <tt>f(3)+f(4)</tt>, which we'd
do as.

<pre>
void main(); {printf("answer %p\n",f(3) + f(4);}
</pre>

This
can be rendered in the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus as

<ul>
(<img src=lambda.gif>f. (+ (f 3) (f 4))
(<img src=lambda.gif>i. (+ 5 i))
</ul>

Leaving aside the fact that we print the answer in C - how you
do input/output in a functional way is a subject to be discussed later,
this works fine, but has an unfortunate form in which the use of
<em>f</em> is placed between the introduction of the variable <em>f</em>
and the <img src=lambda.gif>-abstraction that is its value. Practical
functional languages provide at least one syntactic form that addresses
this problem. In our case we'll write:

<pre>
    let f = \i. 5+i in (f 3) + (f 4) end let
</pre>

<a name = "java"></a>
<h2> Translating from the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus to the
JVM</h2>

<p>The Java Virtual Machine, while intended primarily to support the Java
language, provides something of a generic target architecture for
compilers. In this seminar we will aim to create an implementation of a
simple functional language which runs on the JVM. While we will create Java
classes directly, without using the Java compiler, we can readily specify
what these are by making use of Java syntax itself.

<p>Our language will have
the basic data-types of the Scheme language together with certain types
which are designed to support proof of correctness of programs written in
the language. However, while we will support Scheme data-types, the
language itself will be a more rigorous implementation of the
<img src=lambda.gif>-calculus than Scheme is. The main data-types will each
be a Java class.

<p> The following is an interim specification of some of the types. It
is to be understood that these will be suitably located in the Java
class hierarchy.

<ul>
<li> Numbers: We will define a Java class Number which implements numbers
as defined in the Scheme standard. These will include big-integers and
rationals. There is good reason to use the Object-Oriented capabilities of
Java here, dynamically to choose the appropriate method for operating on
the various kinds of number supported.

<pre>
    n1.add(n2)    adds the numbers n1 and n2
    n1.sub(n2)    subtracts n2 from n1
    n1.mult(n2)   multiplies n1 by n2
    n1.quot(n2)   divides n1 by n2, raising an exception
                  if n2=0
    n1.div(n2)    divides the integer n1 by the integer n2,
                  raising an exception if either is not an
                  integer.
    n.from_int(i) Converts a member of the Java <tt>int</tt> type into a
                  Number
</pre>

<li> Pairs: We will define a Java class Pair. Each p in Pair has two
fields, known as front and back respectively.

<pre>
    Pair.cons(x,y)  This constructs a new pair with fields x and y
    x.front         If x is a pair, this selects the contents
                    of the first field the pair contains.
    x.back          If x is a pair, this selects the contents
                    of the second field the pair contains.

</pre>

<li> Symbols: A symbol is an object that, essentially, is a string. We'll
probably adopt the Scheme convention that symbols with identical sequences
of characters are identical objects, though this fact has to be transparent
to a rigorous implementation of the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus.

<li> Procedures: Every <img src=lambda.gif>-expression is translated into a
<em>procedure</em> object which is the unique member of a class created
as part of the compilation of the <img src=lambda.gif>-expression.

<p>Procedure objects have <em>apply</em>methods. For example, the most
direct translation of <em>(add 5 x)</em> in the <img
src=lambda.gif>-calculus would be

<pre>
    (add.apply(Number.from_int(5))).apply(x)
</pre>
where <em>add</em> is a procedure-object. However, a somewhat more
optimised version of this would use a binary-apply-method <tt>apply_2</tt>

<pre>
    add.apply_2(Number.from_int(5),x)
</pre>
<p>Further optimisation is possible, e.g. to
<tt>Number.from_int(5).add(x)</tt>,
or even <tt>5+x</tt> (if our compiler were convinced that <em>x</em> was
adequately represented by one of the basic types of Java). In fact, the
method-definition for <tt>add</tt> will enshrine the fact that

<pre>
    add.apply_2(x,y) = x.add(y)
</pre>

In particular, we'll create a particular procedure-object <tt>System</tt>
with the property that for any symbol <tt>s</tt>, <tt>System.apply(s)</tt>
is a built-in system capability. For example

<pre>
    System.apply(Symbol.from_string("+"))
</pre>

evaluates to the addition procedure object discussed above.

<h2> Proving that Programs are Correct </h2>

<p>The <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus was intended as a kind of Mathematical
Logic, and we shall use it as such to construct proofs <em>about</em>
programs in our language <em>within</em> our language. Essentially the idea
is that since the  <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus provides the definition of
our language, we can require that any implementation obeys the laws of the
calculus, together with additional laws which characterise the behaviour of
the built-in <em>System</em> capabilities.

<p>For example, suppose we  want to prove that  a sorting function that  we
have written, say <tt>merge_sort</tt>,
is correct. Then since we are operating within
the functional paradigm, <tt>merge_sort</tt>
should be exactly equivalent to an
expression of the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus.  What does it mean to  say
that <tt>merge_sort</tt> is correct? There are two criteria:

<ul>

<li>For any  list  <tt>l</tt> of  data  (possibly a  list  satisfying  some
criterion that is  part of  the specification  of <tt>merge_sort</tt>)  the
result of evaluating

<pre>
        (merge_sort l) </pre>

is sorted. How  do we render  this English requirement  into a  formalism?
Well it's fairly easy to  write a function <tt>sorted</tt> that  determines
if a list <em>is</em> sorted - a list is sorted if it is empty, or contains
one element, or if the first two elements are in order and tail of the list
(everything but the first element) is sorted. So our requirement can be
expressed as</p>

<ul>
     <img src="lambda.gif"> l .(sorted (merge_sort l)) =
     <img src="lambda.gif"> l . true
</ul>

<p>
<li> The other requirement is that <tt>(merge_sort l)</tt> contain
exactly the same elements as <tt>l</tt> itself.
</ul>

<h4>This is a hard problem</h4>
<p>Proving that programs  are correct at  the level of  detail to which  we
aspire is an  undecidable problem, for  our approach is  in effect to  show
that two different programs always produce  the same result when given  the
same data, which is  known to be  undecidable if taken  over a wide  enough
class of programs.

<p>However, there is nothing in the undecidability result which says that
it is impossible to prove that a particular program is correct. So, it is
reasonable to attack the problem of proof with a combination of human
ingenuity controlling a collection of <em>inference rules</em> provided
as functions in the language itself.


<h4> The Abstract Data-type "Theorem"</h4>
<p> Practically, this can be realised by using an abstract data-type
<tt>Theorem</tt> with the property that the only ways a language-user can
get hold of a theorem are guaranteed to ensure the validity of the theorem.

<p> A theorem has two essential components, its <em>premises</em> and its
<em>conclusion</em>. Our theorems will also carry a history with them.
A theorem prints as
<pre>
    premises |- conclusion
</pre>

For example, we might have

<pre>
    Integer.? x, Integer.?y |- x+y = y+x
</pre>

Which states that it doesn't matter whether you add <tt>x</tt> to
<tt>y</tt> or <tt>y</tt> to <tt>x</tt>.


If there are no premises, then we write simply

<pre>
    |-  conclusion
</pre>

For example we require:
<pre>
    |-  x = x
</pre>

<p>The <em>meaning</em> of theorems is a bit tricky to define. Essentially,
the premises are a sequence of things that look like terms of the
<img src="lambda.gif">-calculus, while the conclusion is one of these
term-like things. Notionally, the premises and conclusion "evaluate" to one
of the values "true" or "false", and we require of our theorems  that if
all the premises "evaluate" to true, so does the conclusion.

<p>The tricky bit is that such evaluation is not constructive. This has to
be so because we are interested in proving theorems about <em>equality of
functions</em>.  We'd like, for example to be able to prove that

<pre>
    |-  \x. x+3 = \x. 3+x
</pre>

<p>The conclusion <tt>\x. x+3 = \x. 3+x</tt> looks like a term of the <img
src="lambda.gif">-calculus, but we can't evaluate it in the ordinary way
we'd evaluate a program. Instead, we have to employ a mathematical concept
of evaluation. In this particular case, the meaning of the equality can be
taken to be that if each of these  <img src=lambda.gif>-abstractions is
given any of a countably infinite universe of objects of <em>values</em>,
the results are computably identical.

<p>Theorems provide <em>arbitration</em> between users and implementors.
If a user can exhibit a theorem which says that his program <em>ought</em>
to work, and it doesn't, then he has a cast-iron case for complaining to
the implementor of the language that his implementation is broken.


<h4> Obtaining Theorems </h4>
There are 3 ways that a user can obtain a theorem.
<ul>
<li>A user can access built-in <em>axioms</em> which characterise, as
theorems, the behaviour of the system. The built-in <em>System</em>
function provides access to these axioms.

For example the expression
<pre>
    (System 'Theorem' 'Axiom' 'Integers' 'C_plus')
</pre>
will evaluate to the theorem
<pre>
    (Integer.? x), (Integer.? y) |-
        ((Integer. +) x y) = ((Integer. +) y x)
</pre>
which states that the built-in addition operation is commutative over the
integers.</p>

<li> A user can create theorems by using <em>rules of inference</em> which
are in effect the abstract constructors of the Theorem data-type. For
example:

<pre>
    (BETA '((\x. 5+x) 20)')
</pre>
evaluates to
<pre>
    |- '((\x. 5+x) 20)' = 5+20
</pre>
The <tt>BETA</tt> function thus creates a theorem which says that an
expression is unchanged in "meaning" by <img src=beta.gif>-reduction.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the <em>functional</em> nature of our work is built-in to
rules-of-inference. For the reflexive law of equality is one of the
primitive rules-of-inference:

(REFL 'fred x')

evaluates to the theorem

<pre>
    |-  (fred x)  = (fred x)
</pre>

But it is <em>simply not true</em> that, in an imperative language such as
C, that <tt>fred(x) = fred(x)</tt> for a call of an arbitrary function <tt>
fred</tt> -  fred might side-effect a global variable, so evaluations of
<tt>fred</tt> in apparently identical circumstances can yield different
results.</p>

<li> A user can dignify certain variable-bindings with the status of being
<em>definitions</em>. These take place in a "global" context (one from
which the user can never exit during a session). These are tricky to handle
because we have to make sure that the global variables defined therein
don't get confused with other locals. Suppose we made the simple
definition:

<pre>
Definition double = \x. 2*x
End;
</pre>

As a result, the system creates an object with the status of a theorem:
<pre>
    |- double = \x. 2*x
</pre>


<p>However
we have no control over the scope of such a theorem - we certainly
don't want to get the "double" confused with any one we might want to
define locally.  This is an issue currently unresolved in the design of
POP2000 - it would not however be problematic to ensure in some way that
local and global variables have distinct names, when used in theorems
derived from definitions.
