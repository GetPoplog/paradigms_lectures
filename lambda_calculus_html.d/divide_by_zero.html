To see the difficulty of proving that an exception can never occur,
consider the exception raised by division by zero.
We might think that we could elaborate our type-system to avoid the
possibility of well-typed expressions raising an exception, but this can
rapidly be seen to be impossible -  consider the rational function:

<pre>
                 P[x]
    R[x]   =   --------
                 Q[x]
</pre>

<p>
to know whether R[x] will raise an exception, we have to know the zeros of the
polynomial Q[x], which is a non-trivial (and indeed in a certain sense,
insoluble) problem. Even if we relaxed our requirement to "f(a) evaluates
without exception almost everywhere in A", we still have problems, since to
know that this statement is true of R[x] requires knowledge, if not of
the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, at least of the fact that a polynomial can
have at most n roots, which, if not exactly a profound theorem, is certainly
beyond the scope of knowledge that it is reasonable to expect a type-system to
possess.
