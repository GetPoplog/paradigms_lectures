<h2> Proving that Programs are Correct </h2>

<p>The <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus was intended as a kind of Mathematical
Logic, and  we shall  use it  as such  to construct  proofs  <em>about</em>
programs in our language <em>within</em> our language. Essentially the idea
is that since the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus provides the definition  of
our language, we can require that any implementation obeys the laws of  the
calculus, together with additional laws which characterise the behaviour of
the built-in <em>System</em> capabilities.

<p>For example, suppose we  want to prove that  a sorting function that  we
have written,  say  <tt>merge_sort</tt>,  is correct.  Then  since  we  are
operating within  the functional  paradigm, <tt>merge_sort</tt>  should  be
exactly equivalent to an  expression of the <img  src=lambda.gif>-calculus.
What does it mean to say that <tt>merge_sort</tt> is correct? There are two
criteria:

<ul>

<li>For any  list  <tt>l</tt> of  data  (possibly a  list  satisfying  some
criterion that is  part of  the specification  of <tt>merge_sort</tt>)  the
result of evaluating

<pre>
        (merge_sort l) </pre>

is sorted. How  do we render  this English requirement  into a  formalism?
Well it's fairly easy to  write a function <tt>sorted</tt> that  determines
if a list <em>is</em> sorted - a list is sorted if it is empty, or contains
one element, or if the first two elements are in order and tail of the list
(everything but the first element) is sorted. So our requirement can be
expressed as</p>

<ul>
     <img src="lambda.gif"> l .(sorted (merge_sort l)) =
     <img src="lambda.gif"> l . true
</ul>

<p>
<li> The other requirement is that <tt>(merge_sort l)</tt> contain
exactly the same elements as <tt>l</tt> itself.
</ul>

<h4>This is a hard problem</h4>
<p>Proving that programs  are correct at  the level of  detail to which  we
aspire is an  undecidable problem, for  our approach is  in effect to  show
that two different programs always produce  the same result when given  the
same data, which is  known to be  undecidable if taken  over a wide  enough
class of programs.

<p>However, there is nothing in the undecidability result which says that
it is impossible to prove that a particular program is correct. So, it is
reasonable to attack the problem of proof with a combination of human
ingenuity controlling a collection of <em>inference rules</em> provided
as functions in the language itself.[Theoretical Foundations of Programming
Languages and their Practical Realisation.

<h4> The Abstract Data-type "Theorem"</h4>
<p> Practically, this can be realised by using an abstract data-type
<tt>Theorem</tt> with the property that the only ways a language-user can
get hold of a theorem are guaranteed to ensure the validity of the theorem.

<p> A theorem has two essential components, its <em>premises</em> and its
<em>conclusion</em>. Our theorems will also carry a history with them.
A theorem prints as
<pre>
    premises |- conclusion
</pre>

For example, we might have

<pre>
    Integer.? x, Integer.?y |- x+y = y+x
</pre>

Which states that it doesn't matter whether you add <tt>x</tt> to
<tt>y</tt> or <tt>y</tt> to <tt>x</tt>.


If there are no premises, then we write simply

<pre>
    |-  conclusion
</pre>

For example we require:
<pre>
    |-  x = x
</pre>

<p>The <em>meaning</em> of theorems is a bit tricky to define. Essentially,
the premises are a sequence of things that look like terms of the
<img src="lambda.gif">-calculus, while the conclusion is one of these
term-like things. Notionally, the premises and conclusion "evaluate" to one
of the values "true" or "false", and we require of our theorems  that if
all the premises "evaluate" to true, so does the conclusion.

<p>The tricky bit is that such evaluation is not constructive. This has to
be so because we are interested in proving theorems about <em>equality of
functions</em>.  We'd like, for example to be able to prove that

<pre>
    |-  \x. x+3 = \x. 3+x
</pre>

<p>The conclusion <tt>\x. x+3 = \x. 3+x</tt> looks like a term of the <img
src="lambda.gif">-calculus, but we can't evaluate it in the ordinary way
we'd evaluate a program. Instead, we have to employ a mathematical concept
of evaluation. In this particular case, the meaning of the equality can be
taken to be that if each of these  <img src=lambda.gif>-abstractions is
given any of a countably infinite universe of objects of <em>values</em>,
the results are computably identical.

<p>Theorems provid arbitration between users and implementors.


<h4> Obtaining Theorems </h4>
There are 3 ways that a user can obtain a theorem.
<ul>
<li>A user can access built-in <em>axioms</em> which characterise, as
theorems, the behaviour of the system. The built-in <em>System</em>
function provides access to these axioms.

For example the expression
<pre>
    (System 'Theorem' 'Axiom' 'Integers' 'C_plus')
</pre>
will evaluate to the theorem
<pre>
    (Integer.? x), (Integer.? y) |-
        ((Integer. +) x y) = ((Integer. +) y x)
</pre>
which states that the built-in addition operation is commutative over the
integers.</p>

<li> A user can create theorems by using <em>rules of inference</em> which
are in effect the abstract constructors of the Theorem data-type. For
example:

<pre>
    (BETA '((\x. 5+x) 20)')
</pre>
evaluates to
<pre>
    |- '((\x. 5+x) 20)' = 5+20
</pre>
The <tt>BETA</tt> function thus creates a theorem which says that an
expression is unchanged in "meaning" by <img src=beta.gif>-reduction.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the <em>functional</em> nature of our work is built-in to
rules-of-inference. For the reflexive law of equality is one of the
primitive rules-of-inference:

(REFL 'fred x')

evaluates to the theorem

<pre>
    |-  (fred x)  = (fred x)
</pre>

But it is <em>simply not true</em> that, in an imperative language such as
C, that <tt>fred(x) = fred(x)</tt> for a call of an arbitrary function <tt>
fred</tt> -  fred might side-effect a global variable, so evaluations of
<tt>fred</tt> in apparently identical circumstances can yield different
results.</p>

<li> A user can dignify certain variable-bindings with the status of being
<em>definitions</em>. These take place in a "global" context (one from
which the user can never exit during a session). These are tricky to handle
because we have to make sure that the global variables defined therein
don't get confused with other locals. Suppose we made the simple
definition:

<pre>
Definition double = \x. 2*x
End;
</pre>

As a result, the system creates an object with the status of a theorem:
<pre>
    |- double = \x. 2*x
</pre>


<p>However
we have no control over the scope of such a theorem - we certainly
don't want to get the "double" confused with any one we might want to
define locally.  This is an issue currently unresolved in the design of
POP2000 - it would not however be problematic to ensure in some way that
local and global variables have distinct names, when used in theorems
derived from definitions.
