  Church-Rosser - Call-by-Value and Call-by-Name
</center>

</h1>

Now let's try to tidy up the Church-Rosser Theorem for the <img
src=lambda.gif><img src=alpha.gif> <img src=beta.gif>-calculus.

<p>We don't need to worry about the case illustrated in the second figure,
because it is converted into the case handled by Proposition LC2 by
<img src=alpha.gif>-conversion. The only case left to us to consider
is that in which the inner redux occurs in the argument of the outer redux.

<p>Recall the  diagram of  this case.  If we  perform the  outer  reduction
before the inner one (the "call-by-name"  case), we get a <em>copy</em>  of
the inner redux  for every  occurrence of the  variable of  the outer  <img
src=lambda.gif>-bound  variable   in   the   body   of   the   outer   <img
src=lambda.gif>-abstraction.

<p>If, on the other hand (the  "call-by-value" case), we perform the  inner
reduction before the outer one,  we get exactly one <em>contractum</em>  of
the inner redex, leaving us with a new version of the outer redex with that
contractum in place of the inner redex.

<p>Obviously, to achieve local confluence, we have to reduce those  redexes
(under  discussion)  which   remain  unreduced   in  each   case.  In   the
call-by-value case,  the outer  redex  will be  reduced, resulting  in  the
substitution of the inner contractum for all occurrences of the variable
of the lambda-abstraction of the outer redex in the body of that
abstraction.

<p>However, in the call-by-name case, the inner-redex has been copied  zero
or more times in the body of the lambda-abstraction of the outer redex.  In
order  to  bring   this  "call-by-name"  reduction   into  line  with   the
"call-by-value" case,  we will  have to  reduce <em>every  one</em> of  the
copies of the inner-redex. This  means that we will  need to show that  the
final <em>substitution</em> which occurs in the call-by-value case gives an
identical result to multiple-constructive-updates along paths which are the
effect of multiple applications of our <img src=beta.gif> function.

<p>The practical result of this is that, since (in the call-by-value  case)
we have to <em>separately</em> reduce each copy of the inner-redux, we will
use a distinct path to address each redux. We can characterise multiple
<img src=beta.gif>-reductions by a sequence of paths, each of which
addresses one redux-copy.

<p>How are we to create this path-sequence? Well, let's observe that each
copy of the inner-redux occurs in place of an ocurrence of the outer
lambda-bound variable in the original outer-redux. Thus, if we can make a
list of all paths to occurrences of a specified variable in an expression,
we will be well placed to being able to use such a list (or finite
sequence) as a way of specifying the <img src=beta.gif>-reductions required
to bring the call-by-name form in line with the call-by-value one.
This is achieved by the <a href="#paths"> paths </a> function, defined
below.


<p>However we have to show <em>identity</em> (up to
<img src=alpha.gif>-conversion) of <em>substitution</em> with
multiple <img src=beta.gif> conversions along paths. This is achieved
primarily by <a href = #PT4> Lemma PT4</a> which shows that
the substitution <em>E[v:=F]</em> can be accomplished by a
series of updates of paths leading to <em>v</em> in <em>E</em>

<p>However, before we can begin work upon this key lemma, we need to
refresh our memory about various general functions defined on finite
sequences which are familiar to users of functional languages, to whit
<em>map</em> and <em>reduce</em>.

<p>The <em>reduce</em> function (<b>not</b> to be confused with the term
<em>reduction</em> as we have been using it) takes a binary operation as
argument, and in essence uses that binary operation to combine elements
of a finite sequence together. A second argument is supplied to provide
a <em>base</em> for the combination. It
helps us (or at least it helped me) to
visualise what's going on if we write the binary operation infixed as
<b>o</b>.  Thus, if <em>P</em> is a sequence, then
<ul>
reduce(<b>o</b>,E,P) =
P<sub>1</sub><b>o</b> P<sub>2</sub><b>o</b> P<sub>n</sub><b>o</b>E
</ul>
In this, <b>o</b> associates to the <em>right</em>, to make this clear
let's actually write:

<p><ul>
reduce(<b>o</b>,E,P) =
(P<sub>1</sub><b>o</b>(P<sub>2</sub><b>o</b>..(P<sub>n</sub><b>o</b>E))..)
</ul>
<p>It is essential to remember the right-associativity when we come to
use <em>reduce</em> for real later.

<p>An elementary example of the use of <em>reduce</em> is.
<ul>
reduce(+,0,(3 4 5)) = 3 + 4 + 5 + 0 = 12
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Definition of reduce</h3>
Let <em><b>o</b>: X >&LT; Y->Y</em> be a binary function,
written infixed. Let <em>s</em> be a finite
sequence of members of <em>X</em> .<br> Let <em>y <img src=in.gif> Y</em>
Then the <em>reduce</em> function is defined as follows:

<ul>
<p>RED1    <img src=space.gif><em>reduce(<b>o</b>, y, ()) = y</em>
<p>RED2    <img src=space.gif><em>reduce(<b>o</b>, y, x::s)
                =  x <b>o</b> reduce(<b>o</b>, y, s)</em>
</ul>

<hr>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>The  <em>reduce</em> function as defined above is missing the first
argument that the <tt>reduce</tt> function has in the 287 course.

<hr>
We will also require the function <em>map</em> which transforms one finite
sequence into another, making a systematic modification of every element.
While this can be regarded as a special case of <em>reduce</em>, it's more
convenient to define it separately.


<h3>Definition</h3>
Let <em>f</em> be a function. Let <em>s</em> be a finite sequence.

<ul>
<p>MAP1    <img src=space.gif><em>map(f, ()) = ()</em>
<p>MAP2    <img src=space.gif><em>map(f, x::s) = f(x) :: map(f,s)</em>
</ul>
<hr>
We will also need the concept of <em>concatenating</em> two finite
sequences. Let's define this thus

<h3>Definition  </h3>
The concatenation function, written infix as "<>", is defined by:

<ul>
<p>CC1    <img src=space.gif><em> () <> s = s </em>
<p>CC2    <img src=space.gif><em> (x::s) <> t = x::(s<>t)</em>
</ul>


<hr>
We also need the concept of the <em>extension</em> of a path by one step.
This is simply related to the sequence-constructor operation "::".

<h3>Definition</h3>

<ul>
<p>EXT1    <img src=space.gif><em>ext(s)(p)=s::p</em>
</ul>


<hr>

<a name = "paths">  </a>
<h3>Definition</h3>  Let <em>E</em> be a term of the <img
src=lambda.gif>-calculus. Let <em>v</em> be a variable. Then <em> the paths
leading to <em>v</em> in <em>E</em></em>, written <em>paths(E,v)</em>
are the sequence of paths defined as
follows.

<ul>

<p>PL1  <img src=space.gif><em>paths(v,v) = ((v))  </em>
<p>PL2  <img src=space.gif><em>paths(u,v) = (())   </em>
<p>PL3  <img src=space.gif><em>paths(c,v) = (())   </em>
<p>PL4  <img src=space.gif><em>paths((F G),v) =  map(ext(0),paths(F,v)) <>
                              map(ext(1),paths(G,v))</em>
<p>PL5 <img src=space.gif> <em>paths((<img src=lambda.gif> v. H),v)
= ()</em>
<p>PL6  <img src=space.gif><em>paths((<img src=lambda.gif> u. H),v) =
            map(ext(1), paths(H,v))</em>

</ul>



</ul>
<p>Now the above definition of <em>paths</em> makes use of the
concatenation operator "<>", as well as the map function. Our general
strategy will be to use the <em>reduce</em> function to combine the effects
of multiple <img src=beta.gif>-reductions. Thus inevitably <em>reduce</em>
is going to interact with "<>" and with <em>map</em>. Let's prove a couple
of lemmas that address that interaction.

<p>The following lemma is fairly obvious if we think about <em>reduce</em>
in the right way. Suppose, for example, we have two path-sequences
<em>P</em> and <em>P'</em>. Then

<p><ul>
reduce(<b>o</b>,E,P<>P') =
(P<sub>1</sub><b>o</b>(P<sub>2</sub><b>o</b>..(P<sub>n</sub><b>o</b>
(P'<sub>1</sub><b>o</b>(P'<sub>2</sub><b>o</b>..(P'<sub>n'</sub>
<b>o</b>E))..)
</ul>
We can, by emphasising the bracketing, easily see that the RHS can be
seen as

<ul>
(P<sub>1</sub><b>o</b>(P<sub>2</sub><b>o</b>..(P<sub>n</sub><b>o</b>
 <b>(</b>P'<sub>1</sub><b>o</b>(P'<sub>2</sub><b>o</b>..(P'<sub>n'</sub>
<b>o</b>E)) <b>)</b> .. ) ..)
</ul>
so, it's not surprising that we can treat such a beast as a <em>nested</em>
application of reduce.

<h3>Lemma Red1</h3>
Let  <em>l<sub>1</sub></em> <em>l<sub>2</sub></em> be two finite sequences.
Let <b>o</b> be a binary function, written as an infix. Then
<ul>
reduce(<b>o</b>, b,  l<sub>1</sub> <> l<sub>2</sub>) =
    reduce(<b>o</b>,reduce(<b>o</b>,b,l<sub>2</sub>),l<sub>1</sub>)
</ul>

<h4>Proof</h4>
By induction on <em>length(l<sub>1</sub>)</em>
<h4>Base Case</h4>
If <em>length(l<sub>1</sub>) = 0</em> then <em>l<sub>1</sub> = ()</em>.
<p>On the one hand, from the definition of "<>".
<ul>
<p>reduce(<b>o</b>, b,  l<sub>1</sub> <> l<sub>2</sub>)
 = reduce(<b>o</b>, b,  l<sub>2</sub>)
</ul>
On the other hand, since <em>l<sub>1</sub>=()</em>, by the definition of
<em>reduce</em> we have:

<p><ul>
    reduce(<b>o</b>,reduce(<b>o</b>,b,l<sub>2</sub>),l<sub>1</sub>)
    = reduce(<b>o</b>,reduce(<b>o</b>,b,l<sub>2</sub>),())
<p>    = reduce(<b>o</b>,b,l<sub>2</sub>)
</ul>
<p>Hence the result holds in the base case.

<h4>Inductive Step.</h4>
Suppose for all sequences <em>l</em> for which
<em>length(l) = n</em> that

<p><ul>
reduce(<b>o</b>, b,  l<sub>1</sub> <> l<sub>2</sub>) =
    reduce(<b>o</b>,reduce(<b>o</b>,b,l<sub>2</sub>),l<sub>1</sub>)
</ul>

<p>we have to show that the result holds for a sequence <em>s::l</em>
where <em>length(l) = n</em>. Applying first the definition of "<>" and
then the definition of <em>reduce</em> we obtain
<ul>
reduce(<b>o</b>, b,  (s::l) <> l<sub>2</sub>) =
reduce(<b>o</b>, b,  s:: (l <> l<sub>2</sub>)) =
s <b>o</b> reduce(<b>o</b>, b,  l <> l<sub>2</sub>)
<p>= s <b>o</b> reduce(<b>o</b>,reduce(<b>o</b>,b,l<sub>2</sub>),l)
</ul>
by the inductive hypothesis. On the other hand, using the definition
of <em>reduce</em> we obtain
<ul>
    reduce(<b>o</b>,reduce(<b>o</b>,b,l<sub>2</sub>),s::l)
    = s <b>o</b> reduce(<b>o</b>,reduce(<b>o</b>,b,l<sub>2</sub>),l)
</ul>
<p>Hence the result holds for any sequence <em>s::l</em> of length
<em>n+1</em>. Hence the result holds for all finite sequences.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Note</h4>
It's worth noting that the proof of the above lemma is independent of any
algebraic properties (such as associativity) of the <b>o</b> operation.

<p>Next we come to the interaction of <em>reduce</em> and the use of
<em>map</em> in the definition of <em>paths</em>. In this case, we
prove lemmas specific to the actual use of <em>map</em> in the definition
of <em>paths</em>. These lemmas are motivated by the requirements of <a
href = "#PT4"> Lemma PT4</a>, which shows how substitution can be performed
using path-updates - so those seeking motivation of the immediate lemmas
should perhaps look first at PT4.


<hr>
<h3>Lemma Red2</h3>
Let <em>F, G, H</em> be terms of the lambda-calculus. Let <em>P</em>
be a sequence of paths. Let us define the infix operation <b>o</b> to be,
for any path <em>p</em> and any term <em>E</em>
<ul>
        p <b>o</b> E = E[p:=F]
</ul>
Then
<ul>
reduce(<b>o</b>,(G H), map(ext(1),P)) =
 (G  reduce(<b>o</b>,H,P))
</ul>

<h4>Proof</h4>

By induction on <em>length(P)</em>
<h4>Base Case</em>
<ul>
reduce(<b>o</b>,(G H), map(ext(1),())) = (G H)
</ul>
On the other hand
<ul>
 (G  reduce(<b>o</b>,H,())  = (G H)
</ul>
<h4>Inductive Step</h4>
Suppose that for all path-sequences of length <em>n</em> that

<ul>
reduce(<b>o</b>,(G H), map(ext(1),P)) =
 (G  reduce(<b>o</b>,H,P)
</ul>

Consider a path-sequence  <em>p::P</em> of length <em>n+1</em>.

<ul>
<p>reduce(<b>o</b>,(G H), map(ext(1),p::P))

<p>=reduce(<b>o</b>,(G H), (1::p) :: map(ext(1),P))
</ul>
by the definition of <em>map, ext</em>
<ul>
<p>= (1::p) <b>o</b> reduce(<b>o</b>,(G H), (1::p) :: map(ext(1),P))
</ul>
by the definition of <em>reduce</em>
<ul>
<p> (1::p)  <b>o</b> (G reduce(<b>o</b>,H,P))
</ul>
by the inductive hypothesis. Now, using the definition of <b>o</b> and
of path-update, we obtain
<ul>
<p> = (G reduce(<b>o</b>,H,P))[(1::p) := F]

<p> = (G reduce(<b>o</b>,H,P)[p := F])

<p> = (G p <b>o</b> reduce(<b>o</b>,H,P))

<p> = (G reduce(<b>o</b>,H,p::P))

</ul>
Hence the result holds for any path-sequence of length <em>n+1</em>.
Hence, by the principle of induction, the result holds for all finite
sequences of paths.


<hr>
<h3>Lemma Red3</h3>
Let <em>F, G, H</em> be terms of the lambda-calculus. Let <em>P</em>
be a sequence of paths. Let us define the infix operation <b>o</b> to be,
for any path <em>p</em> and any term <em>E</em>
<ul>
        p <b>o</b> E = E[p:=F]
</ul>
Then
<ul>
reduce(<b>o</b>,(G H), map(ext(0),P)) =
 (reduce(<b>o</b>,G,P) H)
</ul>

<h4>Proof</h4>
Similar to Lemma Red2


<hr>
<h3>Lemma Red4</h3>
Let <em>F, G</em> be terms of the lambda-calculus. Let <em>P</em>
be a sequence of paths. Let us define the infix operation <b>o</b> to be,
for any path <em>p</em> and any term <em>E</em>
<ul>
        p <b>o</b> E = E[p:=F]
</ul>
Then
<ul>
reduce(<b>o</b>,<img src=lambda.gif> x. G, map(ext(1),P)) =
 <img src=lambda.gif> x. (reduce(<b>o</b>,G,P))
</ul>

<h4>Proof</h4>
Similar to Lemma Red2



<hr>
<h3>Building a connection between path-updates and substitution.</h3>
This case of the Church Rosser Theorem requires us to show that a
substitution (of the reduced argument in the body of the
lambda-abstraction of the outer redux) is equivalent to multiple reductions
along a variety of paths. Now it is intuitively obvious that a substitution
can be accomplished by multiple tree-updates along paths. The following
lemma formalises this.


<hr>
<a name = "PT4"> </a>
<h3>Lemma PT4</h3>

Let <em>E,F</em> be a expressions of the lambda-calculus, and let
<em>v</em> be a variable. Suppose no variable free in <em>F</em> is
bound in <em>E</em>. Let us write the infixed <b>o</b> operation
to mean
<ul>
    p<b> o </b>E = E[p:=F]
</ul>
then
<ul> E[v:=F] = reduce(<b>o</b>,E,paths(E,v))
</ul>


<h4>Proof</h4>
By induction of the height of E.
<ul>
<li> Suppose  E = v.
Now from PL1, there is one path to <em>v</em>, of no steps.
<p><ul>
paths(E,v) = (())
</ul>
<p>and, from the definition of <em>reduce</em>
<p><ul>
reduce(<b>o</b>,E,()) = E
</ul>
Thus
<p><ul>
reduce(<b>o</b>,E,paths(E,v)) = p <b>o</b> E = E[p:=F] = F = E[v:=F]
</ul>


<p><li> Suppose E = u,  a variable u <img src=not_eq.gif> v

<p><ul>
reduce(<b>o</b>,E,paths(E,v)) = E = E[v:=F]
</ul>

<p><li>
Suppose E = c,  a constant. This case is similar to the previous one.


</ul>

<h4>Inductive Step</h4>
Suppose for all <em>E</em> for which <em>height(E) <img src=leq.gif> n</em>
we have that

<ul> E[v:=F] = reduce(<b>o</b>, E, paths(E,v))
</ul>

We have to show that the result holds for <em>E</em> for which
<em>height(E)=n+1</em>

<ul>
<li> Suppose <em>E = (G H)</em>, an application.  Then, by PL4

<p><ul>
 paths((F G),v) =  map(ext(0),paths(G,v)) <> map(ext(1),paths(H,v))
</ul>

<p>Hence using Lemma Red1 we obtain

<ul>

<p>RHS = reduce(<b>o</b>,E,paths(E,v))
<p> =  reduce(<b>o</b>, E, map(ext(0),paths(G,v)) <>
map(ext(1),paths(H,v)))
<p> =  reduce(<b>o</b>,
        reduce(<b>o</b>, E, map(ext(1),paths(H,v)),
        map(ext(0),paths(G,v))

</ul>

<p>Now consider the inner <em>reduce</em>
term. We apply Lemma Red2 to this.

<p><ul>
        reduce(<b>o</b>, E, map(ext(1),paths(H,v)))
        = (G reduce(<b>o</b> H paths(H,v)))
        = (G H[v:=F])
<p>
</ul>
by the inductive hypothesis. Substituting in the full expression

<ul>
<p> RHS =  reduce(<b>o</b>, (G H[v:=F]) map(ext(0),paths(G,v)))
<p>
</ul>
<p>which by a similar use of Lemma Red2 is seen to be
<p><ul>
       (G[v:=F] H[v:=F])  = E[v:=F]
</ul>
<p>So the lemma holds in this case (Phew! - and there's more to come).

<p><li> Suppose <em>E = <img src=lambda.gif>v.H </em>

<ul>
<p>E[v:=F] = E<p>
</ul>
On the other hand
<p><ul>
reduce(<b>o</b>,E,paths(E,v)) =
reduce(<b>o</b>,E,()) = E
</ul>
<p>Concluding this case.


<p><li> Suppose <em>E = <img src=lambda.gif>u.H </em>, <em>u <img
src=not_eq.gif> v</em>. Then
<p><ul>
 paths(E,v) =  map(ext(1),paths(H,v))
</ul>
<p>Now, because no variable free in <em>F</em> is bound in <em>E</em>
<ul>
<p>RHS = reduce(<b>o</b>,E,paths(E,v))
<p> =  reduce(<b>o</b>, E, map(ext(1),paths(H,v)))
<p> =  <img src=lambda.gif>u.(reduce <b>o</b>, H, paths(H,v))
</ul>
<p>by Red4. And, from the inductive hypothesis we have
<ul>
<p> =  <img src=lambda.gif>u.H[v:=F])
</ul>
</ul>
<hr>
Unfortunately we've defined the <img src=beta.gif>-function to have its
arguments the wrong way round for the smoothest statement of the next
result. But here goes:
