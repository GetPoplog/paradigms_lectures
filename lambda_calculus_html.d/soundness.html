<hr>

<h4>Definition</h4>
An

<h4>Definition</h4> A theorem is (universally) valid if


<hr>
<h4> Rule 1: We may introduce an assumption </h4>

We may think of this as a way of encoding the tautology <em>t==>t</em>
in theorem form.

<p>ASSUME : Term -> Theorem

<pre>
      __________

        t |- t
</pre>

<tt>ASSUME t</tt> evaluates to the theorem  <tt> t |- t </tt>

<p>For example <tt>ASSUME 'x=2'</tt> evaluates to the theorem
<pre>
    x=2 |- x=2
</pre>

An implementation may raise an exception if the type of <tt>t</tt> in the
current type environment is not <tt>Boolean</tt>.

<hr>
<h4>Rule 2: Discharging an Assumption</h4>

This allows us to perform a step of conversion back from the
<tt>Theorem</tt> form to a Propositional Calculus form. We can remove
a specified term from the premises of a <em>theorem</em> and use it as
the premise of a propositional implication from which the conclusion of the
original theorem follows.

<p><tt>DISCH : Term -> Theorem -> Theorem </tt>

<pre>
                <img src=Gamma.gif>  |-  t<sub>2</sub>
                _________________________

                <img src=Gamma.gif> - {t<sub>1</sub>} |- t<sub>1</sub> ==> t<sub>2</sub>
</pre>

<p>Note that there's no need for <tt>t<sub>1</sub></tt> to be a member
of <img src=Gamma.gif>.  In this case

<pre>   <img src=Gamma.gif>-{t<sub>1</sub>} = <img src=Gamma.gif></pre>

For example <tt>(DISCH  'x=2' (ASSUME 'x=2')) </tt> evaluates to
<ul>
<tt>|- (x=2) ==> (x=2)</tt>
</ul>

<p><tt>(DISCH t<sub>1</sub>)</tt> may raise an exception if
<tt>t<sub>1</sub></tt> is not of type <tt>Boolean</tt> in the current type
environment.

<hr>
<h4>Rule 3: Modus Ponens</h4>

MP: Theorem -> Theorem -> Theorem

<pre>

  <img src=Gamma.gif><sub>1</sub> |- t<sub>1</sub> ==> t<sub>2</sub>        <img src=Gamma.gif><sub>2</sub> |- t<sub>1</sub>
  ___________________________

          <img src=Gamma.gif><sub>1</sub> <img src=cup.gif> <img src=Gamma.gif><sub>2</sub>  |- t<sub>2</sub>

</pre>

Thus <tt>(MP thm1 thm2)</tt> evaluates to a theorem obtained by applying the
Modus Ponens rule as specified above. <tt>MP</tt> raises an exception if
either of its arguments is not a theorem, or if the conclusion of the
first argument is not an implication.

<h3> Rules which specify general facts about equality </h3>

<hr>
<h4> Rule 4: Equality is reflexive </h4>

REFL :  Term -> Theorem

<pre>
    ______________

      |-  t = t
</pre>

<hr>

<h4> Rule 5: Substituting Equal Terms </h4>


SUBST1 : Theorem -> Symbol -> Term -> Theorem -> Theorem

<pre>
    <img src=Gamma.gif><sub>1</sub> |- t<sub>1</sub>=t<sub>2</sub>      <img src=Gamma.gif> t[t<sub>1</sub>]
    ___________________________________

    <img src=Gamma.gif><sub>1</sub>  <img src=cup.gif>  <img src=Gamma.gif>  |- t[t<sub>2</sub>]

</pre>

Here <tt>t[t<sub>1</sub>]</tt> means "a term <tt>t</tt> with some occurrences of
<tt>t<sub>1</sub></tt> singled out (for replacement)".

<p>This is the  most complicated rule.  It embodies the  general notion  that
entities that are <em>equal</em> ought to be interchangeable, so that if,
say, <em>t<sub>1</sub>=t<sub>2</sub></em> then we ought to be able to
replace <em>t<sub>1</sub></em> by <em>t<sub>2</sub></em> in any other
term without changing its meaning. So, for example, if we have a theorem
<tt>  |- x*1 = x </tt>, and we have another theorem

<pre>
    |-  5*(x*1+6) = 5*(x*1) + 5*6
</pre>

then we should be able to conclude that

<pre>
    |- 5*(x*1+6) = 5*x + 5*6
</pre>

Notice that we have only replaced <em>one occurrence</em> of <tt>x*1</tt>
by <tt>x</tt>.

Going back to considering exactly what SUBST1 does, we can say that the
<tt>Symbol</tt> and <tt>Term</tt> arguments support the "singling out"
process. Suppose we call
<pre>
    (SUBST1 thm<sub>1</sub>  v  t<sub>tem</sub>  thm)
</pre>
Where <tt>thm<sub>1</sub></tt> has the form
<tt><img src=Gamma.gif> |- t<sub>1</sub> = t<sub>2</sub> </tt>
and <tt>thm</tt> has the form
<tt><img src=Gamma.gif> |- t </tt>. Then <tt>t<sub>tem</sub></tt> should be equal to
<tt>t</tt> except that certain occurrences of <tt>t<sub>1</sub></tt>
have been replaced by <tt>v</tt> (which variable will not normally
occur  in the theorems). Then <em>exactly those</em> occurrences
of <tt>t<sub>1</sub></tt> which are "marked out" by <tt>v</tt> will be
replaced by <tt>t<sub>2</sub></tt> in the new theorem.

<p>The
<tt>SUBST</tt> rule raises an exception when any of its arguments
fails to have the right form.


<p>[Note - HOL provides a more complicated rule, SUBST. We can write SUBST
using SUBST1, although it will be distinctly less efficient].

<h3> Rules which are  <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus specific.</h3>

The remaining inference-rules encode the  <img src=beta.gif>-reduction
rule and say that the  <img src=lambda.gif>-abstraction of equal terms
gives equal abstractions.

<hr>
<h4> Rule 6: Beta-conversion</h4>

BETA : Term -> Theorem

<pre>
     ____________________________

       |- (\x.E<sub>1</sub>)E<sub>2</sub> = E<sub>1</sub>[x:=E<sub>2</sub>]
</pre>

The argument <tt>t</tt> of <tt>(BETA t)</tt> must have the form of a
<img src=lambda.gif>-abstraction applied to an argument. If so,
<a href = "lambda.html#beta">
<img src=beta.gif>-reduction</a> is performed as specified previously, and
the original and <img src=beta.gif>-reduced forms are equated.

<p>If the term <tt>t</tt> is not a <img src=beta.gif>-redux [i.e. is not of
the form specified] an exception is raised.

<p>For example: <tt> (BETA '(\x. 5+x) 20') </tt> evaluates to
<pre>
    |-  (\x. 5+x) 20 = 5 + 20
</pre>

<hr>
<h4> Rule 7: Abstraction </h4>

ABS : Symbol -> Theorem -> Theorem

<p>The abstraction rule allows us infer the the equality of
abstractions
from the equality of terms.


<pre>
             <img src=Gamma.gif> |- t<sub>1</sub> = t<sub>2</sub>
        _________________________

        <img src=Gamma.gif> |- (\x. t<sub>1</sub>) = (\x. t<sub>2</sub>)
</pre>

<p>Provided <tt>x</tt> does not occur free in <tt><img src=Gamma.gif></tt></p>
</pre>

Example:  <tt> ABS 'x' (REFL 'v') </tt> evaluates to
<pre>
        |- \x.v = \x.v
</pre>

The call
<tt>(ABS v)</tt>  raises an exception if <tt>v</tt> occurs free
in any assumption in <tt><img src=Gamma.gif></tt>.

<hr>

<h2>But We Build Mightily Upon These Rules</h2>

<p>The above inference rules are the "<tt>car, cdr, cons</tt> of
program verification. The list-constructors of LISP and its
descendants <em>police</em> the use  of memory so that users can't
create illegal structures (pointers to nowhere etc.) However one
doesn't (or shouldn't) write programs that create complex
data-structures using just <tt>car, cdr, cons</tt>, but should instead
create levels of abstraction using these primitives.

<p>Likewise we are free to write functions that manipulate theorems
knowing that the only theorems we can <em>create</em> are
provably correct (since we can create a proof of any theorem from the
system axioms by following the sequences of inference-rule
applications).

<h3> Looking inside theorems </h3>
In fact the proof-rules are in effect abstract <em>constructors</em>
for theorems, and play the role of  <tt>cons</tt> in LISP. There's no
harm in <em>looking</em> inside a theorem. This is supported as
follows:

<pre>
Theorem.? : Top->Boolean           Recognises if an object
                                   is a theorem

Theorem.hyp : Theorem->List(Term)  Extracts the list of
                                   hypotheses

Theorem.concl: Theorem->Term       Extracts the conclusion

Theorem.history: Theorem->History  Extracts the inference history of
                                   the theorem.

Theorem.add_history:               Makes a new theorem with an
        Theorem->History->Theorem  appropriate history.
</pre>

The "<tt>add_history</tt>" capability calls for comment. It is an
exception to the rule that users can only create theorems using
proof-methods. In effect, it allows a user to rewrite the history
of a theorem. While this may appear to have Stalinist potential, it
primarily serves to allow <em>useful</em> histories to be created by
higher-level theorem-manipulating functions. The inference-rules
operate at a very fine grain, and it makes sense for higher level
functions to be able to suppress details of this fine-grain operation
in the historical record.

<h3> Writing a Derived Inference Rule </h3>

As an example, let's write a new inference rule,

<pre>
    ADD_ASSUME : Term -> Theorem -> Theorem
</pre>

<tt>(ADD_ASSUME t<sub>1</sub> thm)</tt> simply adds the (redundant)
assumption <tt>t<sub>1</sub></tt> to the existing assumptions of the
theorem. So it embodies a new rule:

<pre>
       <img src=Gamma.gif> |-  t
    ______________

    <img src=Gamma.gif>, t<sub>1</sub>  |- t
</pre>

We can realise this rule with the following definition:

<pre>
Definition ADD_ASSUME =
    \ t1 thm.                       ;;; thm = G |- t, say
        let thm1 = ASSUME t1,       ;;; t1 |- t1
            thm2 = DISCH t1 thm,    ;;; G  |- t1==>t
        in
            MP thm2 thm1            ;;; G,t1 |- t
        endlet
End;
</pre>
