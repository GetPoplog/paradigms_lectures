This is a primer for producing documents in HTML, the hypertext markup language 
used on the World Wide Web. This guide is intended to be an introduction 
to using HTML and creating files for the Web. Links are provided to additional 
information. You should also check your local bookstore; there are many 
volumes about the Web and HTML that could be useful.

<P> 
This primer assumes that you: 
 
<UL> 
<LI>know how to use NCSA Mosaic or some 
    other Web browser  
<LI>have a general understanding of how Web servers and client browsers 
    work  
<LI>have access to a Web server (or that you want to produce HTML documents  
    for personal use in local-viewing mode) 
</UL> 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME = "HV">HTML Version</A></FONT></H4> 
This guide reflects the most current specification--HTML Version 2.0-- 
plus some additional features that have been widely and consistently 
implemented in browsers. Future versions and new features for HTML 
are under development. 
 
 
 
 
 
<P>&nbsp;
<H2><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME = "HD">HTML Documents</A></FONT></H2>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME = "WI">What an HTML Document Is</A></FONT></H4> 
HTML documents are plain-text (also known as ASCII) files that can 
be created using any text editor (e.g., Emacs or vi on UNIX machines; BBEdit  
on a Macintosh; Notepad on a Windows machine). You can also use word-processing  
software if you remember  
to save your document as "text only with line breaks." 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME = "HE">HTML Editors</A></FONT></H4> 
Some WYSIWYG editors are available 
(e.g., HotMetal, which is available for several platforms or  
Adobe PageMill for Macintoshes). 
You may wish to try one of them after you learn some of the basics of  
HTML tagging. It is useful to know enough HTML to code a document 
before you determine the usefulness of a WYSIWYG editor. 
<P> 
If you haven't already selected your software, refer to an  
<A HREF="http://sdg.ncsa.uiuc.edu/~mag/work/HTMLEditors/">online listing of HTML  
editors</A> (organized by platform)  
to help you in your search for appropriate software. 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME = "GY">Getting Your Files on a Server</A></FONT></H4> 
If you have access to a Web server at school or work,   
contact your <DFN>webmaster</DFN> (the individual who maintains the server) to see 
how you can get your files on the Web. If you do not have access to a  
server at work or school, 
check to see if your community operates a <DFN>FreeNet</DFN>,  
a community-based  
network that provides free access to the Internet. Lacking a FreeNet, 
you may need to contact a local Internet provider that will  
post your files on a server for a fee. (Check your local newspaper for advertisements 
or with your Chamber of Commerce for the names of companies.) 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME = "TEM">Tags Explained</A></FONT></H4> 
An <DFN>element</DFN> is a fundamental component of the structure of a text  
document. Some examples of elements are heads, tables, paragraphs, 
and lists. Think of it this way: you use HTML tags to mark the elements 
of a file for your browser. Elements can contain plain text, other 
elements, or both. 
<P> 
To denote the various elements in an HTML document, you use <DFN>tags</DFN>. 
HTML tags consist of a left angle bracket (<SAMP>&lt;</SAMP>), 
a tag name, and a right angle bracket (<SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>).  
Tags are usually paired (e.g.,  
<SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP> and <SAMP>&lt;/H1&gt;</SAMP>) to start and end the  
tag instruction. The end 
tag looks just like the start tag except a slash (/) precedes the 
text within the brackets. HTML tags are <A HREF="#MT">listed below</A>. 
<P> 
Some elements may include an <DFN>attribute</DFN>, which is  
additional information that is included inside the start tag.  
For example, you can specify the alignment of images (top, 
middle, or bottom) by including the  
appropriate attribute with the image source HTML code. 
Tags that have optional attributes are <A HREF="#MT">noted below</A>. 
<P> 
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG><I> HTML is not case sensitive.  
</I><SAMP>&lt;title&gt;</SAMP> is equivalent to  
<SAMP>&lt;TITLE&gt;</SAMP> or <SAMP>&lt;TiTlE&gt;</SAMP>. There are a 
few exceptions noted in <A HREF = "#ES">Escape Sequences</A> below. 
<P> 
Not all tags are supported by all World Wide Web browsers. If a browser 
does not support a tag, it (usually) just ignores it.  
  
 
 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="TM2">The Minimal HTML Document</A></FONT></H4> 
Every HTML document should contain certain standard HTML tags.  
Each document consists of head and body text. The head contains 
the title, and the body contains the actual text that is made 
up of paragraphs, lists, and other elements. Browsers expect 
specific information because they are programmed according to HTML 
and SGML specifications.  
<P> 
Required elements are shown in this  
sample bare-bones document: 
<P> 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;html&gt; 
    &lt;head&gt; 
    &lt;TITLE&gt;A Simple HTML Example&lt;/TITLE&gt; 
    &lt;/head&gt; 
    &lt;body&gt; 
    &lt;H1&gt;HTML is Easy To Learn&lt;/H1&gt; 
    &lt;P&gt;Welcome to the world of HTML.  
    This is the first paragraph. While short it is  
    still a paragraph!&lt;/P&gt; 
    &lt;P&gt;And this is the second paragraph.&lt;/P&gt; 
    &lt;/body&gt; 
    &lt;/html&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
The required elements are the &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, 
and &lt;body&gt; tags (and their corresponding end tags). Because you 
should include these tags in each file, you might want to create a 
template file with them. (Some browsers will format your HTML file correctly 
even if these tags are not included. But some browsers won't! So make sure 
to include them.) 
<P> 
Click to see the <A HREF=SIMPLEEXAMPLE.HTML>formatted version</A> 
of the example. A <A HREF="LongerCoded.html">longer example</A> is also  
available but you should read through the rest of the guide before 
you take a look. This longer-example file contains tags explained  
in the next section. 
<P> 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="TeT">A Teaching Tool</A></FONT></H4> 
To see a copy of the file that your browser reads to generate the  
information in your current window, select View Source (or the equivalent) 
from the browser menu. 
The file contents, with all the HTML tags, are displayed in a new window.  
<P> 
This is an excellent way 
to see how HTML is used and to learn tips and constructs. Of course, the HTML  
might not be technically correct. Once you become familiar with HTML 
and check the many online and hard-copy references on the subject, you 
will learn to distinguish between  
"good" and "bad" HTML.  
<P> 
Remember that you can save 
a source file with the HTML codes and use  
it as a template for one of your Web pages or modify 
the format to suit your purposes. 
 
 
 
 
 
<P>&nbsp;
<H2><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="MT">Markup Tags</A></FONT></H2>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="HT">HTML</A></FONT></H4> 
This element tells your browser that the file contains HTML-coded information. 
The file extension <SAMP>.html</SAMP> also indicates this an HTML 
document and must be used.  
(If you are restricted to 8.3 filenames (e.g., <SAMP>LeeHome.htm</SAMP>,  
use only <SAMP>.htm</SAMP> for your extension.) 
 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="HE2">HEAD</A></FONT></H4> 
The head element identifies the first part of your HTML-coded document that  
contains the title. The title is shown as part of  
your browser's window (see below). 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="TI">TITLE</A></FONT></H4> 
The title element contains your document title and identifies 
its content in a global context. The title is displayed somewhere on the  
browser window (usually at the top), but not within the text area.  
The title is also what is displayed on  
someone's hotlist or bookmark list, so choose something descriptive, 
unique, and relatively short. A title is also used during a WAIS search of  
a server. 
<P> 
For example, you might include a shortened title of a book along with 
the chapter contents: <CITE>NCSA Mosaic Guide (Windows): Installation</CITE>. 
This tells the software name, the platform, and the chapter contents, which is  
more useful than simply calling the document <CITE>Installation</CITE>. 
Generally you should keep your titles to 64 characters or fewer. 
 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="BO">BODY</A></FONT></H4> 
The second--and largest--part of your HTML document is the body, which contains the  
content of your document (displayed within the text area of your 
browser window). The tags explained below are used within the body of your 
HTML document. 
 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="HE3">Headings</A></FONT></H4> 
<P> 
HTML has six levels of headings, numbered 1 through 6, with 1 being 
the most prominent. Headings are displayed in larger and/or bolder 
fonts than normal body text. The first heading in each document should 
be tagged <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP>.  
<P> 
The syntax of the heading element is: 
<BR> 
<SAMP>&lt;H</SAMP><VAR>y</VAR><SAMP>&gt;</SAMP><VAR>Text of heading</VAR><SAMP> 
&lt;/H</SAMP><VAR>y</VAR><SAMP>&gt;</SAMP> 
<BR> 
where <VAR>y</VAR> is a number between 1 and 6 specifying the level 
of the heading.  
<P> 
Do not skip levels of headings in your document. For example, don't  
start with a level-one heading (&ltH1&gt;) and then next use a level-three (&lt;H3&gt;) 
heading. 
 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="PA">Paragraphs</A></FONT></H4> 
<P> 
Unlike documents in most word processors, carriage returns in HTML 
files aren't significant. So you don't have to worry about how long 
your lines of text are (better to have them fewer than 72 characters long though).  
Word wrapping can occur at any point in your 
source file, and multiple spaces are collapsed into a single space by 
your browser.  
<P> 
In the bare-bones example shown in the Minimal HTML Document section,  
the first paragraph is coded as  
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;P&gt;Welcome to the world of HTML.  
    This is the first paragraph.  
    While short it is 
    still a paragraph!&lt;/P&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<P> 
In the source file there is a line break between the sentences. A 
Web browser ignores this line break and starts a new paragraph only 
when it encounters another <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> tag.  
 
<P> 
<STRONG>Important:</STRONG>  
You must indicate paragraphs with &lt;P&gt; elements. A browser 
ignores any indentations or blank lines in the source text. Without 
&lt;P&gt; elements, the document becomes one large paragraph. (One 
exception is text tagged as "preformatted," which is explained below.) 
For example, the following would produce identical output as the first  
bare-bones HTML example: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;H1&gt;Level-one heading&lt;/H1&gt; 
    &lt;P&gt;Welcome to the world of HTML. This is the  
    first paragraph. While short it is still a 
    paragraph! &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;And this is the second paragraph.&lt;/P&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
To preserve readability in HTML files, put headings  
on separate lines, use a blank line or two where it helps identify the  
start of a new section, and separate paragraphs with blank lines 
(in addition to the <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> tags). These extra spaces will help 
you when you edit your files (but your browser will ignore the extra 
spaces because it has its own set of rules on spacing that do not depend 
on the spaces you put in your source file). 
 
<P> 
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> 
The <SAMP>&lt;/P&gt;</SAMP> closing tag can be omitted.  
This is because browsers understand that when they encounter a 
&lt;P&gt; tag, it implies that there is an end to the previous 
paragraph. 
 
<P> 
Using the &lt;P&gt; and &lt;/P&gt; as a paragraph container means that  
you can center a paragraph by including the <SAMP>ALIGN=</SAMP><VAR>alignment</VAR> 
attribute in your source file. 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    <SAMP>&lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;</SAMP> 
    This is a centered paragraph. 
    [See the formatted version below.] 
    &lt;/P&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
<P> 
<P ALIGN=CENTER> 
This is a centered paragraph. 
</P> 
<P> 
 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="LI">Lists</A></FONT></H4> 
HTML supports unnumbered, numbered, and definition lists. You can nest lists 
too, but use this feature sparingly because too many  
nested items can get difficult to  
follow. 
<P> 
<B>Unnumbered Lists</B><P> 
To make an unnumbered, bulleted list, 
<OL> 
<LI>start with an opening list <SAMP>&lt;UL&gt;</SAMP> (for unnumbered 
list) tag 
<LI>enter the <SAMP>&lt;LI&gt;</SAMP> (list item) tag followed by the individual 
    item; no  
    closing <SAMP>&lt;/LI&gt;</SAMP> tag is needed 
<LI>end the entire list with a closing list <SAMP>&lt;/UL&gt;</SAMP> tag 
</OL> 
 
<P> 
Below is a sample three-item list:  
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;UL&gt; 
    &lt;LI&gt; apples 
    &lt;LI&gt; bananas 
    &lt;LI&gt; grapefruit 
    &lt;/UL&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<P> 
The output is: 
 
<UL> 
<LI>apples  
<LI>bananas  
<LI>grapefruit 
</UL> 
 
<P> 
The <SAMP>&lt;LI&gt;</SAMP> items can contain multiple paragraphs. 
Indicate the paragraphs with the <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> paragraph 
tags. 
<P> 
<B>Numbered Lists</B> 
<P> 
A numbered list (also called an <DFN>ordered list</DFN>, from which the tag name 
derives) is identical to an unnumbered list, except it uses <SAMP>&lt;OL&gt;</SAMP> 
instead of <SAMP>&lt;UL&gt;</SAMP>. The items are tagged using the 
same <SAMP>&lt;LI&gt;</SAMP> tag. The following HTML code: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;OL&gt; 
    &lt;LI&gt; oranges 
    &lt;LI&gt; peaches 
    &lt;LI&gt; grapes 
    &lt;/OL&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<P> 
produces this formatted output: 
 
<OL> 
<LI>oranges  
<LI>peaches  
<LI>grapes  
</OL> 
<P> 
<B>Definition Lists</B> 
<P> 
A definition list (coded as <SAMP>&lt;DL&gt;</SAMP>) usually  
consists of alternating a <DFN>definition term</DFN> (coded 
as <SAMP>&lt;DT&gt;</SAMP>) and a definition definition  
(coded as <SAMP>&lt;DD&gt;</SAMP>). 
Web browsers generally format the definition on a new line. 
 
<P> 
The following is an example of a definition list:  
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1">

<P> 
The <SAMP>&lt;DT&gt;</SAMP> and <SAMP>&lt;DD&gt;</SAMP> entries can 
contain multiple paragraphs (indicated by <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> paragraph 
tags), lists, or other definition information.

<B>Nested Lists</B> 
<P> 
Lists can be nested. You can also have a number 
of paragraphs, each containing a nested list, in a single list item. 
 
<P> 
Here is a sample nested list:  
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;UL&gt; 
    &lt;LI&gt; A few New England states: 
 &lt;UL&gt; 
 &lt;LI&gt; Vermont

 &lt;LI&gt; Maine 
 &lt;/UL&gt; 
    &lt;LI&gt; Two Midwestern states: 
 &lt;UL&gt; 
 &lt;LI&gt; Michigan 
 &lt;LI&gt; Indiana 
 &lt;/UL&gt; 
    &lt;/UL&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<P> 
The nested list is displayed as  
 
<UL> 
<LI>A few New England states:

    <LI>New Hampshire  
    <LI>Maine

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="PT">Preformatted Text</A></FONT></H4> 
<P> 
Use the<SAMP> &lt;PRE&gt;</SAMP> tag (which stands for "preformatted") 
to generate text in a fixed-width font. This tag also makes spaces, new lines, 
and tabs significant (multiple spaces are displayed 
as multiple spaces, and lines break in the same locations as in the 
source HTML file). This is useful for program listings, among other things.  
For example, 
the following lines: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;PRE&gt; 
      #!/bin/csh
      cd $SCR  
      cfs get mysrc.f:mycfsdir/mysrc.f    
      cfs get myinfile:mycfsdir/myinfile    
      fc -02 -o mya.out mysrc.f     
      mya.out   
      cfs save myoutfile:mycfsdir/myoutfile  
      rm *     
    &lt;/PRE&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<P> 
display as: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
      #!/bin/csh
      cd $SCR  
      cfs get mysrc.f:mycfsdir/mysrc.f    
      cfs get myinfile:mycfsdir/myinfile    
      fc -02 -o mya.out mysrc.f     
      mya.out   
      cfs save myoutfile:mycfsdir/myoutfile  
      rm * 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<P> 
The <SAMP>&lt;PRE&gt;</SAMP> tag can be used with an optional <SAMP>WIDTH</SAMP>  
attribute that specifies 
the maximum number of characters for a line. <SAMP>WIDTH</SAMP>  
also signals your browser 
to choose an appropriate font and indentation for the text. 
<P> 
Hyperlinks can be used within <SAMP>&lt;PRE&gt;</SAMP> sections. You 
should avoid using other HTML tags within <SAMP>&lt;PRE&gt;</SAMP> 
sections, however. 
 
<P> 
Note that because &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; have special meanings in HTML, 
you must use their escape sequences (<SAMP>&amp;lt;</SAMP>, <SAMP>&amp;gt;</SAMP>, 
and <SAMP>&amp;amp;</SAMP>, respectively) to enter these characters. 
See the section <A HREF = "#ES"> 
Escape Sequences</A> for more information. 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="EQ">Extended Quotations</A></FONT></H4> 
<P> 
Use the <SAMP>&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</SAMP> tag to include lengthy quotations in 
a separate block on the screen. Most browsers generally change the margins 
for the quotation 
to separate 
it from surrounding text. 
 
<P> 
In the example: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;P&gt;Omit needless words.&lt;/P&gt; 
    &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt; 
    &lt;P&gt;Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should 
    contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary 
    sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have 
    no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.
    &lt;/P&gt; 
    &lt;P&gt;--William Strunk, Jr., 1918 &lt;/P&gt; 
    &lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<P> 
the result is: 
    <P>Omit needless words.</P> 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
    <P>Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words,  
    a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing

</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="AD">Addresses</A></FONT></H4> 
<P> 
The <SAMP>&lt;ADDRESS&gt;</SAMP> tag is generally used to specify the 
author of a document, a way to contact the author (e.g., an 
email address), and a revision date. It is usually the last item in a file.  
 
<P> 
For example, the last line of the online version of this guide is:  
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;ADDRESS&gt; 
    A Beginner's Guide to HTML / NCSA / 
    pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu / revised April 96 
    &lt;/ADDRESS&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<P> 
The result is: 
<ADDRESS>A Beginner's Guide to HTML / NCSA / pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu / revised April 96</ADDRESS> 
 
<P> 
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> <SAMP>&lt;ADDRESS&gt;</SAMP> is <EM>not</EM> 
used for postal addresses. See "Forced Line Breaks" below to 
see how to format postal addresses. 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="FL">Forced Line Breaks/Postal Addresses</A></FONT></H4> 
<P> 
The <SAMP>&lt;BR&gt;</SAMP> tag forces a line break with no extra  
(white) space 
between lines. Using <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> elements 
for short lines of text such as postal 
addresses results in unwanted additional white space.  
For example, with &lt;BR&gt;: 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1">

    <P> 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="HR">Horizontal Rules</A></FONT></H4> 
<P> 
The <SAMP>&lt;HR&gt;</SAMP> tag produces a horizontal line the width 
of the browser window. A horizontal rule is useful to separate 
sections of your document. For example, many people add a rule 
at the end of their text and before the  <SAMP>&lt;address&gt; </SAMP> information. 
<P> 
You can vary a rule's size (thickness) and width (the  
percentage of the window covered 
by the rule).  
Experiment with the settings until you are satisfied with the presentation. 
For example: 
<PRE><FONT SIZE=-1> 
&lt;HR SIZE=4 WIDTH="50%"&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
displays as: <HR SIZE=4 WIDTH=50%> 
 
 
 
<P>&nbsp;
<H2><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="CF">Character Formatting</A></FONT></H2>
HTML has two types of styles for individual words or sentences:  
logical and physical. <DFN>Logical styles</DFN> 
tag text according to its meaning, while <DFN>physical styles</DFN> 
indicate the specific appearance of a section. For example, in the preceding 
sentence, the words "logical styles" was tagged as a "definition." 
The same effect (formatting those words in italics) could have been 
achieved via a different tag that tells your browser to "put these words 
in italics." 
<P> 
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Some browsers don't attach any style to the 
<SAMP>&lt;DFN&gt;</SAMP> tag, so you might not see the indicated phrases in the 
previous paragraph in italics. 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="PV">Logical Versus Physical Styles</A></FONT></H4> 
<P> 
If physical and logical styles produce the same result on the screen, 
why are there both?  
<P> 
In the ideal SGML universe, content is divorced from presentation. 
Thus SGML tags a level-one heading as a level-one heading, but does 
not specify that the level-one heading should be, for instance, 24-point 
bold Times centered. The advantage of this approach 
(it's similar in concept to style sheets in many word processors) is 
that if you decide to change level-one headings to be 20-point left-justified 
Helvetica, all you have to do is change the definition of the level-one 
heading in your Web browser. Indeed many 
browsers today let you define how you want the various  
HTML tags rendered on-screen. 
 
<P> 
Another advantage of logical tags is that they help enforce consistency 
in your documents. It's easier to tag something as <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP> 
than to remember that level-one headings are 24-point bold Times centered or 
whatever. For example, consider 
the <SAMP>&lt;STRONG&gt;</SAMP> tag. Most browsers render it in bold 
text. However, it is possible that a reader would prefer that these 
sections be displayed in red instead. Logical styles offer this flexibility. 
 
<P> 
Of course, if you want something to be displayed in italics  
(for example) and do not  
want a browser's setting to  display it differently, use  
physical styles. Physical 
styles, therefore, offer consistency in that something you  
tag a certain way will always be 
displayed that way for readers of your document. 
<P> 
Try to be consistent about which type of style you use.  
If you tag with physical  
styles, do so throughout a document. If you use logical styles,  
stick with them 
within a document. Keep in mind that future releases of HTML might  
not support 
physical styles, which could mean that browsers will not display  
physical  
style coding.

Character entities have two functions: 
<UL> 
<LI>escaping special characters 
<LI>displaying other characters not available in the  
plain ASCII character set (primarily characters with 
diacritical marks) 
</UL> 
Three ASCII characters--the left angle bracket 
(&lt;), the right angle bracket (&gt;), and the  
ampersand (&amp;)--have special meanings in HTML and therefore 
cannot be used "as is" in text. (The angle brackets are used to indicate 
the beginning and end of HTML tags, and the ampersand is used to indicate 
the beginning of an escape sequence.) 
Double quote marks may be used as-is but a character entity 
may also be used (&amp;quot;). 
<P> 
To use one of the three characters in an HTML document, you must enter 
its <DFN>escape </DFN><DFN>sequence</DFN> instead: 
 
<DL COMPACT>

<H2><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="LI2">Linking</A></FONT></H2>
The chief power of HTML comes from its ability to link text 
and/or an image to another document or section of a document. A browser highlights the 
identified text or image with color and/or underlines to indicate that it 
is a <DFN>hypertext link</DFN> (often shortened to <DFN>hyperlink</DFN> or 
<DFN>link</DFN>). 
 
<P> 
HTML's single hypertext-related tag is <SAMP>&lt;A&gt;</SAMP>, which 
stands for <DFN>anchor</DFN>. To include an anchor in your document: 
 
<OL> 
<LI>start the anchor with <SAMP>&lt;A</SAMP>  (include a space after 
    the <CODE>A</CODE>) 
<LI>specify the document you're linking to by entering the parameter 
    <SAMP>HREF=&quot;</SAMP><VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>&quot;</SAMP> 
    followed by a closing right angle bracket (<SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>) 
<LI>enter the text that will serve as the hypertext link in the current 
    document 
<LI>enter the ending anchor tag: <SAMP>&lt;/A&gt;</SAMP> (no space 
is needed before the end anchor tag) 
</OL> 
 
<P> 
Here is a sample hypertext reference in a file called <SAMP>US.html</SAMP>:  
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;A HREF=&quot;MaineStats.html&quot;&gt;Maine&lt;/A&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<P> 
This entry makes the word <I>Maine</I> the hyperlink to the  
document <SAMP>MaineStats.html</SAMP>, 
which is in the same directory as the first document.  
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="RL">Relative Pathnames Versus Absolute Pathnames</A></FONT></H4> 
<P> 
You can link 
to documents in other directories by specifying the <DFN>relative path</DFN> 
from the current document to the linked document. For example, a link 
to a file <SAMP>NYStats.html</SAMP> located in the subdirectory  
<SAMP>AtlanticStates</SAMP> 
would be: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;A HREF=&quot;AtlanticStates/NYStats.html&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/A&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<P> 
These are called <DFN>relative links</DFN> because you are  
specifying the path to the linked file relative to the location of the current file.  
You can also use the absolute 
pathname (the complete URL) of the file, but relative links are more efficient 
in accessing a server.  
<P> 
Pathnames use the standard UNIX syntax. The UNIX syntax for the parent directory 
(the directory that contains the current directory) is "..".  (For 
more information consult a beginning UNIX reference text such as  
<CITE>Learning the UNIX Operating System</CITE> from O'Reilly 
and Associates, Inc.) 
<P> 
 
If you were in the <SAMP>NYStats.html</SAMP> file and were referring to the original  
document <SAMP>US.html</SAMP>, your link would look like this: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;A HREF=&quot;../US.html&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/A&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
 
In general, you should use relative links because: 
 
<OL> 
<LI>it's easier to move a group of documents to another location (because 
    the relative path names will still be valid) 
<LI>it's more efficient connecting to the server 
<LI>there is less to type 
</OL> 
 
<P> 
However use absolute pathnames when linking to documents that are 
not directly related. For example, consider a group of documents that 
comprise a user manual. Links within this group should be relative 
links. Links to other documents (perhaps a reference to related software) 
should use full path names. This way if you move the user manual to 
a different directory, none of the links would have to be updated. 
 
 
 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="UR">URLs</A></FONT></H4> 
<P> 
The World Wide Web uses Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to specify 
the location of files on other servers. A URL includes the type of 
resource being accessed (e.g., Web, gopher, WAIS), the address of the server, 
and the location of the file. The syntax is:

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="LTS">Links to Specific Sections</A></FONT></H4> 
<P> 
Anchors can also be used to move a reader to a <I>particular section</I> in a document (either 
the same or a different document) rather than to the top, which is the default. This type 
of an anchor is commonly called a <DFN>named anchor</DFN> because to create the links, 
you insert HTML names within the document. 
<P> 
This guide is a good example of using named anchors in one document.  
The guide is constructed as one document to make 
printing easier. But as one (long) document, it can be time-consuming 
to move through when all you really want to know about is one bit of 
information about HTML.  
Internal hyperlinks are used to create a "table of 
contents" at the top of this document. These hyperlinks move you from 
one location in the document to another location in the same document.  
(Go to the <A HREF="#top">top</A> of this document and then click on the <CITE> 
Links to Specific Sections</CITE> hyperlink in the table of contents. 
You will wind up back here.) 
<P>  
You can also link to a specific section in another document. That information is 
presented first because understanding that helps you understand linking within one  
document.  
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">Links Between Sections of Different Documents</FONT></H4> 
Suppose you want to set a link from document A (<SAMP>documentA.html</SAMP>)  
to a specific section 
in another document (<SAMP>MaineStats.html</SAMP>).  
<P> 
Enter the HTML coding for a link to a  
named anchor: 
<PRE><FONT SIZE=-1> 
     <SAMP>documentA.html</SAMP>: 
      
     In addition to the many state parks, Maine is also home to  
     &lt;a href="MaineStats.html#ANP"&gt;Acadia National Park&lt;/a&gt;. 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
Think of the characters after the hash (#) mark as a tab within the 
<SAMP>MaineStats.html</SAMP> file. This tab tells your browser 
what should be displayed at the top of the window when the link is activated. 
In other words, the first line in your browser window should be the  
Acadia National Park heading. 
<P> 
Next, create the <DFN>named anchor</DFN> (in this example "ANP")  
in <SAMP>MaineStats.html</SAMP>:  
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
  &lt;H2&gt;&lt;A NAME=&quot;ANP&quot;&gt;Acadia National Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H2&GT;
 </FONT></PRE> 
With both of these elements in place, you can bring a reader directly to  
the Acadia reference in <SAMP>MaineStats.html</SAMP>. 
<P> 
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> You cannot make links to specific sections  
within a different document unless either 
you have write permission to the coded source of that document or that document  
already contains 
in-document named anchors. For example, you could include  
named anchors to this primer in a document you are writing because  
there are named anchors  
in this guide (use View Source in your browser to see the coding).  
But if this document did <I>not</I> have named  
anchors, you could 
not make a link to a specific section because you cannot edit the original  
file on NCSA's server. 
 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">Links to Specific Sections within the Current Document</FONT></H4> 
<P> 
The technique is the same except the filename is <EMPHASIS>omitted</EMPHASIS>.  
 
<P> 
For example, to link to the <SAMP>ANP</SAMP> anchor from  
within <SAMP>MaineStats</SAMP>, enter: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
  ...More information about 
  &lt;A HREF="#ANP"&gt;Acadia National Park&lt;/a&gt;  
  is available elsewhere in this document. 
    </FONT></PRE>  
 
Be sure to include the <SAMP>&lt;A NAME=&gt;</SAMP> tag at the  
place in your document 
where you want the link to jump to (<SAMP>&lt;H2&gt;&lt;A  
NAME=&quot;ANP&quot;&gt;Acadia National Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;</SAMP>). 
<P> 
Named anchors are particularly useful when you think readers will print a document

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="M2">Mailto</A></FONT></H4> 
<P> 
You can make it easy for a reader to send electronic mail to a specific 
person or mail alias by including the <SAMP>mailto</SAMP> attribute in a hyperlink. 
The format is: 
<PRE><FONT SIZE=-1> 
&lt;A HREF="mailto:<var>emailinfo@host</var>"&gt;<VAR>Name</VAR>&lt;/a&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
For example, enter: 
<PRE><FONT SIZE=-1> 
 &lt;A HREF="mailto:<var>pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu</var>"&gt;
 <VAR>NCSA Publications Group</VAR>&lt;/a&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
to create a mail window that is already configured to open a mail window for the  
<A HREF="mailto:pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu">NCSA Publications 
Group</A> alias. (You, of course, will enter another mail address!) 
 
 
 
<P>&nbsp;
<H2><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="II">Inline Images</A></FONT></H2>
Most Web browsers can display inline images (that is, images next 
to text) that are in X Bitmap (XBM), GIF, or  
JPEG format. Other image formats 
are being incorporated into Web browsers [e.g., the Portable 
Network Graphic (PNG) format]. Each image takes 
time to process and slows down the initial display of a document.  
Carefully select your images and the number of images in  
a document. 
<P> 
To include an inline image, enter: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;IMG SRC=<VAR>ImageName</VAR>&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<P> 
where <VAR>ImageName</VAR> is the URL of the image file.  
<P> 
The syntax 
for <SAMP>&lt;IMG SRC&gt;</SAMP> URLs is identical to that used in an anchor 
<SAMP>HREF</SAMP>. If the image file is a GIF file, then the filename 
part of <VAR>ImageName</VAR> must  end with <SAMP>.gif</SAMP>. 
Filenames of X Bitmap images must end with <SAMP>.xbm</SAMP>; 
JPEG image files must end with <SAMP>.jpg</SAMP> or <SAMP>.jpeg</SAMP>;  
and Portable Network Graphic files must end with <SAMP>.png</SAMP>. 
 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="IS">Image Size Attributes</A></FONT></H4> 
You should include two other attributes on 
<SAMP>&lt;IMG&gt;</SAMP> tags to tell your browser the size  
of the images 
it is downloading with the text. The <SAMP>HEIGHT</SAMP>  
and <SAMP>WIDTH</SAMP> attributes 
let your browser set aside the appropriate space (in pixels) for 
the images as it downloads the rest of the file. (Get the pixel size 
from your image-processing software, such as Adobe Photoshop.) 
<P> 
For example, to include a self portrait image in a file along with the  
portrait's dimensions, enter: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;IMG SRC=SelfPortrait.gif HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=65&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
<P> 
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Some browsers use the <SAMP>HEIGHT</SAMP>  
and <SAMP>WIDTH</SAMP> attributes to stretch or shrink an image to fit 
into the allotted space when the image does not exactly match 
the attribute numbers. Not all browser developers think stretching/shrinking 
is a good idea. So don't plan on your readers having access to this 
feature. Check your dimensions and use the correct ones. 
 
 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="AI">Aligning Images</A></FONT></H4> 
You have some flexibility when displaying images. You can have images 
separated from text and aligned to the left or right or centered. Or you can have 
an image aligned with text. Try several possibilities to see how your information 
looks best. 
<P> 
 
<B>Aligning Text with an Image</B><BR> 
<IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif" ALT = ""> 
By default the bottom 
of an image is aligned with the following text, as shown in this paragraph.  
You can align images to the top or center of a paragraph using  
the <SAMP>ALIGN=</SAMP> attributes <SAMP>TOP</SAMP> and <SAMP>CENTER</SAMP>. 
<P> 
<IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif" ALT = "" ALIGN=TOP> This text is aligned with  
the top of the image (<SAMP>&lt;IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif"  
ALIGN=TOP&gt;</SAMP>). Notice how  
the browser aligns only one line and then jumps to the bottom of the image for  
the rest of the text. 
<P> 
<IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif" ALT = "" ALIGN=CENTER> And this text is centered on  
the image (<SAMP>&lt;IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif" ALIGN=CENTER&gt;</SAMP>).  
Again, only one line 
of text is centered; the rest is below the image. 
<P> 
 
 
<P> 
<B>Images without Text</B> 
<BR> 
To display an image without any associated text (e.g., your organization's 
logo), make it a separate paragraph. Use the paragraph  
<SAMP>ALIGN=</SAMP> attribute to center the image or  
adjust it to the right side of the window as shown below: 
<PRE><FONT SIZE=-1> 
&lt;p ALIGN=CENTER&gt; 
&lt;IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif"&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
which results in: 
<P ALIGN=CENTER> 
<IMG SRC="BarHotlist.gif" ALT = ""> 
</P> 
 
The image is centered; this paragraph starts below it and left justified. 
<P> 
 
 
 
 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="AT2">Alternate Text for Images</A></FONT></H4> 
<P> 
Some World Wide Web browsers--primarily those that run on VT100  
terminals--cannot  
display images. Some users turn off image loading even if their 
software can display images 
(especially if they are using a modem or have a slow connection).  
HTML provides a  
mechanism to tell readers what they are missing on your pages. 
<P> 
The <SAMP>ALT</SAMP> attribute lets you specify 
text to be displayed instead of an image. For example: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;UpArrow.gif&quot; ALT=&quot;Up&quot;&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<P> 
where <SAMP>UpArrow.gif </SAMP>is the picture of an upward pointing 
arrow. With graphics-capable viewers that have image-loading turned on, you 
see the up arrow graphic. With a VT100 browser or if image-loading is 
turned off, the word <I>Up</I> is shown in your window. 
<P> 
You should try to include alternate text for each image you use  
in your document, which 
is a courtesy for your readers. 
 
 
 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="BG">Background Graphics</A></FONT></H4> 
Newer versions of Web browsers can load an image and use it as a background  
when displaying a page. Some people like background images and some don't. In 
general, if you want to include a background, make sure your text can be read easily 
when displayed on top of the image. 
<P> 
Background images can be a texture (linen finished paper, for example) or an  
image of an object (a logo possibly).  
You create the background image 
as you do any image.  
<P> 
However you only  
have to create a small 
piece of the image. Using a feature called tiling, a browser takes  
the image and repeats  
it across and down to fill  
your browser window. In sum you generate one image, and the browser 
replicates it enough times to fill your window. This action is automatic when  
you use the background tag shown below. 
<P> 
The tag to include a background image is included in  
the <SAMP>&lt;BODY&gt;</SAMP>  
statement as an attribute: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
&lt;BODY BACKGROUND="<var>filename</var>.gif"&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="OC">
Background Color</A></FONT></H4> 
By default browsers display text in black on a gray background. 
However, you can change both elements if you want. Some HTML authors select a  
background color and coordinate 
it with a change in the color of the text.  
<P> 
Always preview changes like  
this to make sure your 
pages are readable. (For example, many people find red text on a black  
background difficult to read!) 
<P> 
You change the color of text, links, visited links, and active links 
using attributes of the <SAMP>&lt;BODY&gt;</SAMP> tag. For example, enter: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE=-1> 
&lt;BODY BGCOLOR="#000000" TEXT="#FFFFFF" LINK="#9690CC"&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
This creates a window with a black background (<SAMP>BGCOLOR</SAMP>), white text 
(<SAMP>TEXT</SAMP>), and silvery hyperlinks (<SAMP>LINK</SAMP>). 
<P>  
The six-digit number and letter combinations represent colors 
by giving their RGB (red, green, blue) value. The six digits  
are actually three two-digit numbers in sequence, representing  
the amount of red, green, or blue as a hexadecimal value  
in the range 00-FF. For example, 000000 is black (no color  
at all), FF0000 is bright red, and FFFFFF is white (fully  
saturated with all three colors).  These number and letter combinations  
are cryptic. Fortunately an online resource is  
available to help you track down the combinations that map  
to specific colors and there is software available for you to do this on 
your workstation: 
 
<UL> 
<LI><A HREF="http://www.hidaho.com/colorcenter/">hIdaho ColorCenter</A><BR> 
</UL> 
 
 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="EI">External Images, Sounds, and Animations</A></FONT></H4> 
<P> 
You may want to have an image open as a separate document when a user 
activates a link on either a word or a smaller, inline version of 
the image included in your document. This is called an external 
image, and it is useful if you do not wish to slow down the loading of 
the main document with large inline images. 
 
<P> 
To include a reference to an external image, enter:  
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;A HREF="<VAR>MyImage.gif</VAR>"&gt;link anchor&lt;/A&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
You can also use a smaller image as a link to a larger image. Enter: 
<PRE><FONT SIZE=-1> 
     &lt;A HREF="<VAR>LargerImage.gif</VAR>"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC="<VAR>SmallImage.gif</VAR>"&gt;&lt;/A&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
The reader sees the <SAMP>SmallImage.gif</SAMP> image and clicks on it to  
open the <SAMP>LargerImage.gif</SAMP> file. 
<P> 
Use the same syntax for links to external animations and sounds. 
The only difference is the file extension of the linked file. For example, 
 
<P> 
<SAMP>&lt;A HREF=&quot;AdamsRib.mov&quot;&gt;link anchor&lt;/A&gt;</SAMP> 
 
<P> 
specifies a link to a QuickTime movie. Some common file types and their 
extensions are:

<H2><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="TA">Tables</A></FONT></H2>
Before HTML tags for tables were finalized, authors had to carefully  
format their tabular information 
within <SAMP>&lt;PRE&gt;</SAMP> tags, counting spaces and previewing their output.   
Tables are very useful for presentation of tabular information as  
well as a boon to  
creative HTML authors who use the table tags to present their  
regular Web pages. (Check out the  
<A HREF="http://jean-luc.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">NCSA Relativity Group's pages</A> for an  
excellent, award-winning example.) 
<P> 
Think of your tabular information in light of the coding explained below. A 
table has heads where you explain what the columns/rows include, rows for information,  
cells for each item. In the following table, the first column contains the  
header information, each row explains an HTML table tag, and each cell contains a  
paired tag or an explanation of the tag's function.

The general format of a table looks like this: 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
&lt;TABLE&gt;  
   start of table definition 
 
&lt;CAPTION&gt; caption contents &lt;/CAPTION&gt;      
  caption definition 
 
&lt;TR&gt;     
  start of first row definition 
&lt;TH&gt; cell contents &lt;/TH&gt;      
  first cell in row 1 (a head) 
<P> 
&lt;TH&gt; cell contents &lt;/TH&gt;      
  last cell in row 1 (a head) 
&lt;/TR&gt;    
  end of first row definition  
&lt;TR&gt;     
  start of second row definition 
&lt;TD&gt; cell contents &lt;/TD&gt;
  first cell in 
row 2 <P> 
&lt;TD&gt; cell contents &lt;/TD&gt;      
  last cell in row 2 
&lt;/TR&gt;    
  end of second row definition 
<P> 
&lt;TR&gt;     
  start of last row definition 
&lt;TD&gt; cell contents &lt;/TD&gt;
  first cell in last row ... 
&lt;TD&gt; cell contents &lt;/TD&gt;      
  last cell in last row 
&lt;/TR&gt;    
  end of last row definition 
 
&lt;/TABLE&gt; 
  end of table definition 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
The <SAMP>&lt;TABLE&gt;</SAMP> and <SAMP>&lt;/TABLE&gt;</SAMP>  
tags <B>must</B> surround the  
entire table definition.  The first item 
inside the table is the <SAMP>CAPTION</SAMP>, which is optional.   
Then you can have any  
number of rows defined by the 
<SAMP>&lt;TR&gt;</SAMP> and <SAMP>&lt;/TR&gt;</SAMP> tags.   
Within a row you can have any number of  
cells defined by the <SAMP>&lt;TD&gt;</SAMP>...<SAMP>&lt;/TD&gt;</SAMP> or  
<SAMP>&lt;TH&gt;</SAMP>...<SAMP>&lt;/TH&gt;</SAMP> tags. Each  
row of a table is, essentially, formatted independently of the rows above and below 
it. This lets you easily display tables like the one above with a single 
cell, such as Table Attributes, spanning columns of the table. 
<P> 
 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="TF">Tables for Nontabular Information</A></FONT></H4> 
Some HTML authors use tables to present nontabular information.  
For example, because links 
can be included in table cells, some authors use a table 
with no borders to create "one" image from separate images. 
Browsers that can display tables properly  
show the various 
images seamlessly, making the created image seem like an  
<DFN>image map</DFN> (one image with hyperlinked  
quadrants).  
<P> 
Using table borders 
with images can create an impressive display as well. Experiment and see  
what you like. 
 
 
 
 
<P>&nbsp;
<H2><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="FF">Fill-out Forms</A></FONT></H2>
Web forms let a reader  
return information to a Web server for some action.  
For example, suppose you collect names and email addresses so you can email some 
information to people who request it. For each person who enters his or her 
name and address, you need 
some information to be sent and the respondent's particulars added to a data base.  
<P> 
This processing 
of incoming data is usually handled by a script or program written in Perl or 
another language that manipulates text, files, and information. If you cannot write a  
program or script for your incoming information, you need to find someone who can do  
this for you.  
<P> 
The forms themselves are not hard to code. They follow the same constructs 
as other HTML tags. What could be difficult is the program or script that takes 
the information submitted in a form and processes it. Because of the need for 
specialized scripts to handle the incoming form information,   
<A HREF = "/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/fill-out-forms/overview.html">fill-out forms</A> 
are not discussed in this primer. Check the <A HREF="#AR">Additional Online Reference</A>  
section for more information.

<H2><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="TR">Troubleshooting</A></FONT></H2>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="AO">Avoid Overlapping Tags</A></FONT></H4> 
<P> 
Consider this example of HTML: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;B&gt;This is an example of &lt;DFN&gt;overlapping&lt;/B&gt; 
    HTML tags.&lt;/DFN&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<P> 
The word <I>overlapping</I> is contained within both the <SAMP>&lt;B&gt;</SAMP> 
and <SAMP>&lt;DFN&gt;</SAMP> tags. A browser might be confused by this  
coding and might not display it the way you intend. The only way to know is to 
check each popular browser (which is time-consuming and impractical). 
<P> 
In general, avoid overlapping tags. Look at your tags and try pairing them up. 
Tags (with the obvious exceptions of elements whose end tags 
may be omitted, such as paragraphs)  
should be paired without an intervening tag in between. Look again at the  
example above. You cannot pair the bold tags without another tag in the middle (the 
first definition tag). Try matching your coding up like this to see if you  
have any problem areas that should be fixed before your release your   
files to a server. 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="OE">Embed Only Anchors and Character Tags</A></FONT></H4> 
<P> 
HTML protocol allows you to embed links within other HTML tags: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;H1&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;Destination.html&quot;&gt;My heading&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H1&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<P> 
<EM>Do not</EM> embed HTML tags within an anchor: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;A HREF=&quot;Destination.html&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;H1&gt;My heading&lt;/H1&gt; 
    &lt;/A&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<P> 
Although most browsers currently handle this second example, the official HTML  
specifications do not support this construct and your file will probably not work with 
future browsers. Remember that browsers can be forgiving when displaying improperly 
coded files. But that forgiveness may not last to the next version of the software! 
When in doubt, code your files according to the HTML specifications (see <A HREF= 
"#FM">For More Information</A> below). 
 
<P> 
Character tags modify the appearance of the text within other elements: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;UL&gt; 
    &lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;A bold list item&lt;/B&gt; 
    &lt;LI&gt;&lt;I&gt;An italic list item&lt;/I&gt; 
    &lt;/UL&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<P> 
Avoid embedding other types of HTML element tags. For example, 
you might be tempted to embed a heading within a list in order to make the 
font size larger: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;UL&gt; 
    &lt;LI&gt;&lt;H1&gt;A large heading&lt;/H1&gt; 
    &lt;LI&gt;&lt;H2&gt;Something slightly smaller&lt;/H2&gt; 
    &lt;/UL&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
 
<P> 
Although some browsers handle this quite nicely, formatting of such 
coding is unpredictable (because it 
is undefined). For compatibility with all 
browsers, avoid these kinds of constructs. (The Netscape &lt;FONT&gt; tag, 
which lets you specify how large individual characters will be displayed 
in your window, is not currently part of 
the official HTML specifications.) 
 
<P> 
What's the difference between embedding a <SAMP>&lt;B&gt;</SAMP> within 
a <SAMP>&lt;LI&gt;</SAMP> tag as opposed to embedding a <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP> 
within a <SAMP>&lt;LI&gt;</SAMP>? 
Within HTML the semantic meaning of <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP> is that it's the main 
heading of a document and that it should be followed by the content 
of the document. Therefore it doesn't make sense to find a <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP> 
within a list. 
 
<P> 
Character formatting tags also are generally not additive. For example, you might 
expect that: 
 
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
    &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;some text&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
 
<P> 
would produce bold-italic text. On some browsers it does; other browsers 
interpret only the innermost tag. 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="FS">Do the Final Steps </A></FONT></H4> 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">Validate Your Code</FONT></H4> 
When you put a document on a Web server, be sure to  
check the formatting and each link (including named anchors). Ideally you will 
have someone else read through and comment on  
your file(s) before you consider a document 
finished.  
<P> 
You can run your coded files through an
<A HREF="http://valsvc.webtechs.com/">HTML validation service</A> 
that will tell you if your code conforms  
to accepted HTML. If you are not sure your coding conforms to HTML specifications, this 
can be a useful teaching tool. Fortunately the service lets you select the level 
of conformance you want for your files (i.e., strict, level 2, level 3). If you 
want to use some codes that are not officially part of the HTML specifications, 
this latitude is helpful. 
<P> 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">Dummy Images</FONT></H4> 
When an <SAMP>&lt;IMG SRC&gt;</SAMP> tag points to an image that does not 
exist, a dummy image is substituted by your browser software.  
When this happens during your final review of your files, make sure that 
the referenced image does in fact exist, that the hyperlink has the 
correct information in the URL, and that the file permission is set 
appropriately (world-readable). Then check online again! 
<P> 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">Update Your Files</FONT></H4> 
If the contents of a file are static (such as a biography of George Washington), 
no updating is probably needed. But for documents 
that are time sensitive or covering a field that changes frequently, 
<STRONG> remember to update your documents!</STRONG>  
<P> 
Updating is particularly important when the 
file contains information such as a weekly schedule or  
a deadline for a program funding announcement.  
Remove out-of-date files or note why something that 
appears dated is still on a server (e.g., the program requirements will remain 
the same for the next cycle so the file is still available as an interim reference). 
<P> 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">Browsers Differ</FONT></H4> 
Web browsers display HTML elements differently.  
Remember that not all codes used in HTML files are interpreted by all 
browsers. Any code a browser does not understand is usually ignored though. 
<P> 
You could spend a lot of time making your file "look perfect" using your 
current browser. If you check that file using another browser, it will likely 
display (a little or a lot) differently. Hence these words of  
advice: code your files using  
correct HTML. Leave the interpreting to the browsers and hope for the best. 
 
 
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><A NAME="CO">Commenting Your Files</A></FONT></H4> 
You might want to include comments in your HTML files. Comments in HTML are like 
comments in a computer program--the text you enter is not used by the browser in 
any formatting and is not directly viewable by the reader just as computer 
program comments are not used and are not viewable. The comments are accessible 
if a reader views the source file, however. 
<P> 
Comments such as the name of the person updating a file, the software 
and version used in creating a file, or the date that a minor edit was  
made are the norm. 
<P> 
To include a comment, enter: 
<PRE><FONT SIZE=-1> 
    &lt;!-- <VAR>your comments here</VAR> --&gt; 
</FONT></PRE> 
You must include the exclamation mark and the hyphens as shown.
