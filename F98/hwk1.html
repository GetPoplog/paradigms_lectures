Write a Scheme Function <tt>cosrule</tt> which uses the <em>cosine
rule</em>

<ul>
c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - 2ab<b> cos</b> t
</ul>

to work out the length of one side <em>c</em> of a triangle given the
lengths <em>a,b</em> of the other two sides and the included angle
<em>t</em> between them. The function call should be

<pre>
    (cosrule a b t)
</pre>

and it should return the length of the side as a result.

(example '(cosrule 10 10 0) 0.0)
