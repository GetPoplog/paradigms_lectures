<h4> Abelson and Sussman </h4>

Chapter 1 of Abelson and Sussman is entitled "<em>Building Abstractions
with Procedures</em>".

Chapter 2 of Abelson and Sussman is entitled "<em>Building Abstractions
with Data</em>".

We shall discuss many of the ideas covered in these chapters during the
course, but not in exactly the same order.

You will find a discussion of <em>Data Abstraction</em> in section 2.1 of
Ableson and Sussmann (p83 ff.) See also section 1.1.8 <em> Procedures as
Black Box Abstractions</em> (p26 ff.).

<h2><a name = "abstract">The need for abstraction</a></h2>


<p>  In  abstraction  we  <em>draw  out</em>  (from  the  Latin  verb  <em>
traho</em> I pull (c.f. <em>tractor</em>), and the preposition  <em>ab</em>
meaning "from" or "away from") an essential aspect of an idea, allowing  it
to be applied to more than the particular set of circumstances in which  we
first encountered it. We have already seen this at work when we  considered
the <tt>sum</tt> function and abstracted  it to obtain the  <tt>reduce</tt>
function.


<p> An important  principle in the  design of computational  systems is  to
provide a measure of <em> isolation  of the implementation of a  capability
from its  users</em>.  Thus a  user  is required  to  employ some  kind  of
standard <em>interface</em> in accessing a capability. In doing this we are
<em>abstracting</em> the <em>essence</em> of the capability from the  point
of view of its users.

<p> For example, in computer hardware, a standard <em>bus</em> such as  the
VME bus can  be used to  connect modules. In  operating systems, access  to
backing store is mediated via system-calls.

<p>
This isolation offers  two primary advantages:
<UL>

<p> <em> The implementation  can be improved  or changed without  affecting
how it is used</em>. Provided the  user adheres to the standard  interface,
(s)he need not alter how (s)he uses the capability.

<p>
    Thus for example, in hardware, a larger memory module can be plugged into
    the standard bus and can be immediately usable. In operating systems, a
    file system local to a particular machine can be replaced by a distributed
    file system with minimal disruption to users.


<p> <em>Safety features can be built into the implementation</em>.
    Generally it is true
    that not all states of a resource are legal. For example, in an operating
    system, each block on the disc should either belong to one named file, or
    should be known to be free. Ensuring that this remains true can remain the
    responsibility of the operating system (OS) provided that the user only
    accesses the disc via the <em>abstraction</em> that the OS provides,
    namely the file.
</UL>

<p>
Sometimes a mechanism is provided  to <em>police</em> the safety  features.
For example  in the  Unix operating  system, it  is impossible  for a  user
program to issue an input-output  instruction to access the disc  directly.
Any such instruction will be  <em>trapped</em> by the machine hardware  and
referred to the <em>kernel</em> of  the OS. On the  other hand, in the  DOS
operating system, there is no such protection, so that correct usage of the
disc is dependent on programmer discipline.

<p>
Likewise, in the  Scheme language,  any access  to the  machine's store  is
mediated by the <tt>car</tt>,<tt>cdr</tt> and <tt>cons</tt> functions. This
prevents certain  kinds of  illegality from  occurring. For  example it  is
impossible in  a Scheme  system for  a piece  of store  to be  regarded  as
<em>free</em> when in fact it forms part of a user's data-structure.

<p>
By contrast, in the C language, the user has free access to her entire virtual
machine, so that it is possible for a piece of store to be used in two
contradictory ways by a single program.

<p>
However there is often a <em>performance penalty</em> associated with using
a standard  interface.  During the  evolution  of computer  hardware,  many
bus-standards have become obsolete as technology has advanced. For example,
memory is  now supplied  as SIMM's  which plug  directly into  a  processor
board.

Likewise the writers of computer  games are notorious for employing  direct
access to graphics hardware, rather than employing the standard  interface,
in order to achieve the necessary speed.

<p>
Likewise,  the  use  of  the  <tt>car</tt>,<tt>cdr</tt>  and  <tt>cons</tt>
functions in Scheme may carry a performance penalty compared with the  more
direct access offered  by C.  Not all  storage configurations  that can  be
created by  C can  be created  by Scheme.  Moreover the  storage  integrity
demanded by Scheme  can require  that these  primitive functions  perform a
check that the <tt>car</tt> and <tt>cdr</tt> functions are being applied to
lists. The issue of efficiency is a complex one, and does not always  imply
that languages  like Scheme  are more  inefficient than  C, especially  for
large programs.

<h2> Levels of Abstraction </h2>

<p>Any engineered system of any complexity exhibits  abstraction layered
into levels. In computer hardware, levels of abstraction are imposed by
technology - there is at least a chip-level, a board-level and a
system-level. Within the chip-level, there are further levels of
abstraction - at least a device level and a register-level. With a
processor chip there will be larger functional units, e.g. an ALU or a
cache.

<p> For each level of abstraction there are two separate problems to be
addressed
<UL>
<LI> Implementing that level of abstraction.
<LI> Using that level of abstraction.
</UL>

These are very different activities. Using ought to be very much easier
than implementing if the abstraction is worthwhile.

<h3>Building Levels of Abstraction within Scheme.</h3>




<p>
While  <tt>car</tt>,<tt>cdr</tt> and <tt>cons</tt>
provide a  base abstract view  of the machine  store,
they operate at a low conceptual level, not related to what most programs  are
<em>about</em>.
We can use them, and other facilities of Scheme, as building blocks  to
provide abstractions appropriate to the requirements of a given program by


<UL>
    <LI> <em> Defining functions which implement the concepts which are
    needed
    for the program</em>. For example, if we are interested in geometric
    computations, we
    will need functions to implement points, lines, planes, circles,
    spheres...

    <LI>
    Writing the rest of the program using only this basic set of functions.
</UL>

<p> Within  a purely  functional approach,  implementation requires  us  to
define <em>constructor  functions</em>  to  build  representations  of  the
objects and <em>selector functions</em> to access such representations.  At
the base-level, <tt>cons</tt> is  a constructor function <tt>car,  cdr</tt>
are the selectors.

<h3>  Example 1 A point </h3>


<h4>Implementation of points</h4>

<pre><code>
(define (mk_point x y)   ; the basic constructor function
    (list x y))

(define x_point car)     ; two selector functions.
(define y_point cadr)
</code></pre>

<h4>Use of points</h4>


<p>
From now on we use only <tt>mk_point, x_point and y_point</tt>
to construct and access points.
For example:


<pre><code>
(define (mid_point p1 p2)
    (mk_point
        (/(+ (x_point p1) (x_point p2)) 2)
        (/(+ (y_point p1) (y_point p2)) 2)
        )
    )

(example '(mid_point (mk_point 1 2) (mk_point 5 8)) (mk_point 3 5))


(define (diff_point p1 p2)
    (mk_point
        (- (x_point p1) (x_point p2))
        (- (y_point p1) (y_point p2))
        )
    )
</code></pre>


So any code we write to manipulate points is quite independent of the
implementation of points.


<h4>New implementation of points</h4>
If we make the representation of points more mnemonic:

<pre><code>
(define (mk_point x y)
    (list 'point x y))

(define x_point cadr)
(define y_point caddr)
</code></pre>

our <tt>mid_point</tt> function will still work!

<pre><code>
(example '(mid_point (mk_point 1 2) (mk_point 5 8)) (mk_point 3 5))

example: (mid_point (mk_point 1 2) (mk_point 5 8)) = (point 3 5),  ok!
                                                      |
Note however that the print out is different here -----
</code></pre>

<h2><a name = "layer_abstract">Layers of Abstraction</a></h2>

<p>We
can build one abstraction on top of another. For example, we can use points
to define lines:



<h3>  Example 2 A line </h3>

<h4> Implemention of lines </h4>

<pre><code>
(define (mk_line x0 y0 x1 y1)
    (let (
         (p_0 (mk_point x0 y0))
         (p_1 (mk_point x1 y1))
         )
        (list p_0 p_1))
    )
</code></pre>


<pre><code>
(define point_0_line car)
(define point_1_line cadr)
</code></pre>

<h4>   Use of lines </h4>

<pre><code>
(define (length_line l)
    (let* (
         (p0 (point_0_line l))
         (p1 (point_1_line l))
         (p  (diff_point p0 p1))
         (x  (x_point p))
         (y  (y_point p)))
        (sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y)))
        )
    )

(define l1 (mk_line 0 1 6 7))

(define l2 (mk_line 0 4 7 8))

(length_line l1)
</code></pre>


<h2><a name="record-class">Using <tt>record-class</tt> to create opaque
records.</a></h2>

<p>
UMASS Scheme provides opaque records as an option. The function-call
<pre>
    (record-class <b>class_info spec</b>)
</pre>
<p>
will return  a  list-structure  containing record  access  functions.  Here
<b>class_info</b> is  a symbol or other structure that is common to all
members of the class.
The parameter <b>spec</b>
is a list of <em>field</em> specifiers. A field specifier  says
what kind of data  can be held in  a field. The only  kind of specifier  we
will use is the symbol <tt>'object</tt>,
which creates a field able to  hold
any Scheme object.

<hline>
Historical Note: The record-class capability is non-standard for Scheme.
It is derived from the <tt>recordfns</tt> capability of POP-2
[Burstall and Popplestone   1968], as modified for POP-11 [Barrett, Ramsay
& Sloman 1985].
<hline>

)

<p>
The <tt>record-class</tt>
function returns a list of four items:


<OL>
<LI>
    The first is a constructor function for the record-class. This takes as
    many arguments as there are field-specifier in the <b>spec</b>
    and builds a record containing them.
<LI>
    The second is a destructor function for the record-class. This takes
    a record created by the constructor and makes a list of the objects
    out of which the record was constructed.
<LI>
    The third is a list of selector functions for the record-class, one
    for each field-specifier in the <b>spec</b>.
    Each selector function extracts
    the contents of the appropriate field.
<LI>
    The fourth is a function for recognising members of the record-class.
</OL>

<p>
For example we might do:

<pre><code>
(define class_point (record-class 'point '(object object)))

(define mk_point  (car class_point))
(define sel_point (caddr class_point))
(define x_point   (car sel_point))
(define y_point   (cadr sel_point))
</code></pre>
You may also use

<pre><code>
(define dest_point  (cadr class_point))
(define point?      (cadddr class_point))
</code></pre>

<hr>


<h2> <a name = object_orientation>
Starting to write  an object-oriented capability  for Scheme.</a></h2>  The
<tt>record-class</tt> capability  allows to  create opaque  data-structures
which can only be accessed  by the appropriate selector functions.  However
the selector  functions  as we  have  used them  just  live in  the  global
name-space. This  is a  problem if  we try  to build  a big  system out  of
software components written  by disparate  authors since we  can't be  sure
that some people won't use the same names for different functions. This, of
course, is  a problem  for the  C language,  which also  has a  big  global
name-space.

<p>Another problem is that we may want  to have a class of objects that  in
some way <em>extends</em> another class. For example, if we were  modelling
a university, then we would want to have a basic <tt>person</tt> class that
was <em>extended</em> to a  <tt>student</tt> class. That  is a student  has
all the  attributes of  a person  (name,  age, sex  let's say),  plus  some
others, for example a list of courses that he or she is taking.

<p>And  finally   we   may   want   to  say   that   a   particular   class
<em>implements</em>  some  kind   of  abstractly-defined  capability.   For
example, we might have a notion  of what software to manipulate sets  ought
to provide - membership, union and intersection operations, say.

<p>The <tt>record-class</tt> facility of UMASS Scheme provides a basic
tool-kit for addressing the above issues; however "spilling out" the
package of capabilities provided by <tt>record-class</tt> into global
name-space is not a good basis for maintaining encapsulation. One paradigm
that supports encapsulation is the usual <em>object-oriented</em> paradigm,
in which the capabilities associated with a class of objects remain
encapsulated in a class-structure which is accessible primarily via objects
of the class. One Scheme view of this might be to implement
object-orientation in terms of a call to a function "send" which passes a
message to an object. So, instead of writing  <tt>(x_point p)</tt>, we
would instead write:

<pre>
    (send p 'x)
</pre>

Implementing this kind of capability is something of a doddle using
<tt>record-class</tt>, since we can use the first argument of the call to
provide class-common information. However actually doing this will have to
wait on us knowing about the imperative paradigm in Scheme.

<h2> 6  Field Specifiers for Poplog Data </h2>

This section  lists the  permissible field  type specifiers  for  Poplog
data, i.e. that can appear in the SPEC or SPEC_LIST argument to  conskey
(SPEC_LIST is a list of type specifiers for a record class, and SPEC  is
a single one for a vector class).

<DL>
<DT><b>Full Poplog Item</b>
<DD>
This is  the quickest  field  type to  access  or update,  since  it
    requires no conversion  to and  from Poplog  representation, and  no
    check on values assigned into  it, etc (see 'Representation of  Data
    in Poplog' in <tt>REFù*ùDATA</tt>).
<TABLE BORDER=1>

              Holds a single Poplog  item, and occupies one

<DD>
    These fields can contain integers  only, either signed or  unsigned,
    represented in a fixed number of binary bits.
        When accessed, such a field produces a Poplog simple integer  or
    biginteger (the  latter only  for a  field having  more bits  than a
    simple integer -  29 bits  unsigned or  30 bits  signed in  current
    implementations - and the value overflows this range).  Similarily,
    a simple  integer or  biginteger  within the  range allowed  can  be
    assigned into the field.
        The named types correspond to standard sizes on the host machine
    (and are always aligned on appropriate boundaries to be  efficiently
    accessible), whereas fields specified as  a specific number of  bits
    (i.e.  N  or  -N)  are  'bitfields'  and  are  generally  slower  to
    access/update (and in a structure, simply occupy the next N bits).
