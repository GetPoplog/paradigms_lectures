<h2>Operations on sets and the representations we'll consider</h2>

<p>
A set is  a fundamental  concept of  mathematics. Unfortunately,  there is  no
single uniform representation  of set  that meets  all our  needs as  computer
scientists. The  most important  distinction is  between finite  and  infinite
sets. A finite set can be represented by some kind of explicit enumeration  in
a data-structure, whereas an infinite set must be represented by some kind  of
description that does not explicitly enumerate the elements. Of course, it  is
not always practicable to enumerate large finite sets.

<p>
We shall study three representations of finite sets from the point of view of
a small number of basic operations on sets:


<pre>
    empty_set            The representation of the empty set.

    (list->set  l)       Creates a set which consists of the elements of a
                         list.

    (set->list  s)       Creates a list of the elements of the set in an
                         undefined order. This will be the identity function
                         for representations of sets as lists.

    (member_set? x s)    Computes whether a given object x is a member of a
                         set s.

    (included_in? s1 s2) Computes whether each member of s1 is a member of s2

    (equal_set? s1 s2)   Computes whether two sets s1 s2 are the same set.

    (adjoin x s)         Makes a new set by adding the element x to the set s.

    (intersect s1 s2)    Computes the intersection of the two sets s1, s2.

</pre>
<p>
In particular we need to study the relationship between the representation and
how fast we can make these basic operations run - their time complexity.

<p>
The 3 representations are

<pre>
    Unordered lists: A set {1,2,3} may be represented as the list (3 1 2)
    Ordered lists:   A set {1,2,3} will be represented as the list (1 2 3)
    Binary trees:    A set {1,2,3,4,5} may be represented as the tree:
</pre>

<center>
<IMG SRC = "sets_as_trees0.gif">
</center>


<p>
All of these representations require that  we be able to compare for  equality
<em>elements</em>
which  occur  in sets.  The  ordered list  and  tree  representations
require that an ordering relation be defined on the elements. For  simplicity,
we shall  confine  ourselves to  sets  of numbers,  where  &lt;=
is  an  ordering relation.

<a name = "generic"></a>
<h2> Generic functions on sets.</h2>


<p>
We can regard  the functions <tt>set->list</tt>,  <tt>member_set?</tt>,
<tt>adjoin</tt> together with <tt>empty_set</tt> as being  basic operations which we have  to
define for all representations of sets. Using these, we can provide generic
implementations of <tt>list->set</tt>, <tt>included_in?</tt>,
<tt>equal_set?</tt> and <tt>intersect</tt>. While
these generic implementations will always work, they will not always be the
fastest possible implementation for a given representation, since we may be
able to exploit the special properties of that representation.

<h3> 2.1  The generic implementation of  <tt>list->set</tt> </h3>


<p>
We can  convert  a  list to  a  set  by repeated  application  of  the  <tt>adjoin</tt>
operation, giving us the function:

<pre><code>
(define (list->set l)
    (if (null? l) empty_set
        (adjoin (car l) (list->set (cdr l)))
        )
    )
</code></pre>

<h3> The generic implementation of <tt>intersect</tt></h3>

<p>
We can conveniently make use of the <tt>reduce</tt>
function that we defined earlier in
the course to save us writing some explicit recursions.

<pre><code>
(define (reduce f acc base l)
   (if (null? l)
       base
       (acc (f (car l)) (reduce f acc base (cdr l)))))
</code></pre>

<p>
Using <tt>reduce</tt>
we can write a  generic <tt>intersect</tt> function. This converts one  of
the sets to a list, and then uses an accumulator function in which <tt>member_set?</tt>
is used to determine if each member of the list is a member of the other  set.
If it is, it  is combined into the  result, and if not  it isn't. The base  is
simply the <tt>empty_set</tt>.

<pre><code>
(define (intersect s1 s2)
    (reduce
        (lambda (x) x)                   ;f
        (lambda (x s)                    ;acc
            (if (member_set? x s2)
                (adjoin x s)
                s)
            )
        empty_set                        ;base
        (set->list s1)                   ;list
        )
    )
</code></pre>

2.3  The generic implementation of  included_in?

Likewise, we can define <tt>included_in?</tt>
with <tt>reduce</tt>. Here the base is <tt>#t</tt> and  the
accumulator function  is the  "and"  operation, and  the mapping  function  is
<tt>member_set?</tt>

<pre><code>
(define (included_in? s1 s2)
    (reduce
        (lambda (x) (member_set? x s2))    ;f
        andf                               ;acc
        #t                                 ;base
        (set->list s1))                    ;list
    )
</code></pre>


We need to define <tt>andf</tt>
as a proper function, since <tt>and</tt> is a special form which
can't be passed as an argument.

<pre><code>
(define (andf b1 b2)
    (and b1 b2)
    )
</code></pre>

<h3>2.4  The generic implementation of  <tt>equal_set?</tt></h3>

We can define <tt>equal_set?</tt> in terms of <tt>included_in?</tt>:

<pre><code>
(define (equal_set? s1 s2)
    (and (included_in? s1 s2) (included_in? s2 s1))
    )
</code></pre>

<a name = "unordered"></a>
<h2>3  Sets as unordered lists</h2>


<p>
A set can be represented as a list with no duplicates. The fact that the  list
contains  no   duplicates  can   be  regarded   as  an   invariant  for   this
representation.

<h3>3.1  Implementing the empty set as an unordered list</h3>

<p>
The empty set is simply implemented as the empty list.


<pre><code>
(define empty_set '())
</code></pre>

<h3>3.2 Implementing <tt>set->list</tt> representing sets as unordered
lists </h3>

<p>
In this representation     <tt>set->list</tt>  is the identity function (but note that
<tt>list->set</tt>  has to remove duplicates).

<pre><code>
(define set->list (lambda (x) x))
</code></pre>



<h3>3.3 Implementing <tt>member_set?</tt> representing sets as unordered
lists </h3>

<p>
To implement set  membership, we  can use  the built-in  <tt>member</tt>
function,  but ensure that an actual boolean value is returned.

<pre><code>
(define (member_set? x s)
    (if (member x s) #t #f)
    )
</code></pre>

<p>
This takes O(n) time, since <tt>member</tt>
takes O(n) time to go through the list  and
compare each element for equality with <tt>x</tt>.


<h3>3.4
Implementing <tt>adjoin</tt>  representing sets as unordered lists </h3>

<p>
For <tt>(adjoin x s)</tt>
we need to test  membership and only <tt>cons</tt>  on <tt>x</tt> to
the  list
representing s if it is not already there. This preserves the "no  duplicates"
invariant.

<pre><code>
(define (adjoin x s)
    (if (member_set? x s)
        s
        (cons x s)
        )
    )
</code></pre>

<p>
This takes  <em>O(n)</em>
time,  since <tt>member_set?</tt>  takes  O(n) time.

<h3>3.5  Use the generic functions for <tt>intersect, equal_set? </tt></h3>


<p>
We can use  the generic definitions  of <tt>intersect</tt>
and  <tt>equal_set?</tt>. These  both
take <em> O(n^2)</em> time.

<p>
Provided we have compiled Lecture 12, we can test out our implementation using
the testing functions contained in that lecture.

<pre><code>
(test_laws_sets 100)
</code></pre>


<a name = "ordered"></a>
<h2>4  Sets as ordered lists</h2>




<p>
If we add the additional requirement (invariant) that our sets be  represented
as lists with the elements placed in  order, we find that intersection can  be
done more efficiently.


<h3>4.1  Implementing the empty set as an ordered list</h3>

<p>
As before, the empty_set is represented by the empty list.

<pre><code>
(define empty_set '())
</code></pre>

<h3>4.2 Implementing <tt>set->list</tt> representing sets as ordered
lists</h3>

<p>
As before, <tt>set->list</tt> is simply the identity function.

<pre><code>
(define set->list (lambda (x) x))
</code></pre>


4.3  Implementing <tt>member_set?</tt>  representing sets as ordered lists
-----------------------------------------------------------------

<p>
We can make <tt>member_set?</tt> rather more efficient. Assuming a uniform distribution
of values of x we can halve the expected time for an evaluation of
<tt>( member_set x s)</tt>
in the cases in which <tt>x</tt> actually is a member of s by
using the fact  that
if the first member of s larger than x we cannot possibly find x in s (see (1)
below). However <tt>member_set?</tt> still remains O(n).

<pre><code>
(define (member_set? x s)
    (cond
        ((null? s) #f)
        ((= x (car s)) #t)
        ((> (car s) x) #f)                  ; (1)
        (else (member_set? x (cdr s)))
        )
    )
</code></pre>

<h3>4.4  Implementing <tt>adjoin</tt>  representing sets as ordered
lists</h3>

<p>
In this representation,  <tt>adjoin</tt> still takes O(n) time, since we have
in the worst case to examine the entire list. For example:

    (adjoin  5 (list->set '(1 2 3 4))) ==> (1 2 3 4 5)

<p>
But we can achieve a small improvement if we recognise that if the first
member of the list representing the set is greater than the element we are
adjoining, then we don't have to look any further.


<pre><code>
(define (adjoin x s)
    (cond
        ( (null? s) (list x))
        ( (&lt; x (car s)) (cons x s))
        ((= x (car s)) s)
        (else (cons (car s) (adjoin x (cdr s))))
        )
    )
</code></pre>

<h3>4.5  We have a big win implementing intersect on ordered lists</h3>


<p>
However we  can  improve  our implementation  of  <tt>intersect</tt>
significantly  by
exploiting the fact that the two sets are represented as ordered lists. To  do
this we  employ  a  kind  of  algorithm known  as  <em>merging</em>.

<p>
The function below, based on merging, takes <em>O(n)</em>
where <em>n</em> is the maximum of the
size (cardinality) of the two sets. The idea is that we go through the ordered
lists in "lock step" successively comparing the first elements and deciding on
the basis of the comparison whether to incorporate them in the result,  always
taking the <tt>cdr</tt> of the list with the smaller first element.

 <pre>
     '(2 3 4 6 7)
     '(1 3 5 6)         First element not in the intersection, take cdr

     '(2 3 4 6 7)       First element not in the intersection, take cdr
     '(3 5 6)

     '(3 4 6 7)         First elements are in the intersection, take cdr
     '(3 5 6)           of both, incorparate car's in the result.

     '(4 6 7)           First element not in the intersection, take cdr
     '(5 6)

     '(6 7)
     '(5 6)             First element not in the intersection, take cdr


     '(6 7)             First elements are in the intersection, take cdr
     '(6)               of both, incorporate car's in the intersection.

     '(7)
     '()               No elements in the intersection.
</pre>


<pre><code>
(define (intersect s1 s2)
    (if (or (null? s1) (null? s2)) '()
        (let (
             (x1 (car s1))
             (x2 (car s2))
             ); end let binding
            (cond
                ((= x1 x2) (cons x1 (intersect (cdr s1) (cdr s2))))
                ((&lt; x1 x2) (intersect (cdr s1) s2))
                (else (intersect s1 (cdr s2)))
                ) ;end cond
            ) ; end let
        ) ;end if
    ) ;end define
</code></pre>

<p>
We can test  for the equality  of sets under  the ordered list  representation
very simply - if they are equal as sets they must be equal as lists.

<pre><code>
(define equal_set? equal?)
</code></pre>

<p>
Note that <tt>intersect</tt>
is an example of a general kind of operation, the <tt>merge</tt> in
which two ordered  sequences are  compared in  lock-step to  produce a  result
derived from both of them. This is a very important kind of algorithm in cases
in which you have large sets of data and only have sequential access to  them.
It past  years, the  only way  that large  data-sets could  be stored  was  on
magnetic tape,  and all  commercial  data-processing depended  on the  use  of
merging operations. For example  a bank would have  records of the balance  of
customer accounts  on  one  (or  more  than  one!)  tape,  kept  in  order  of
account-number. The transactions  for the day  would be put  on another  tape,
also in order of account-number. Then  the two tapes would be merged,  thereby
updating the  balances to  allow for  the transactions.  Even the  process  of
preparing the sorted-tape  for merging  would take place  using a  merge-based
sorting operation.

<p>
Now we can test out our implementation.

<h2>5  Sets as Trees - an Introduction </h2>

<p>
If we represent a set as a <em>balanced</em>
tree we can achieve a significant speed up
in evaluating the  <tt>member_set?</tt> and <tt>adjoin</tt>  functions. The idea  of a  balanced
tree is illustrated below - essentially the  idea is that we want to  equalise
the number  of  entries  to  the  left  and right  of  each  node  as  far  as
practicable.</p>

<center>
<IMG SRC = "sets_as_trees.gif">
</center>

<p>
If a tree is balanced, we can get  to any given node in a rather small  number
of steps, in fact in a number  of steps logarithmic in the cardinality  (size)
of the set represented in the tree. The details of how we can achieve this are
discussed in Lecture 15.
