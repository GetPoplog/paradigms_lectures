<h2>Content</h2>

<p>Using the Lisp dialect Scheme as a backdrop, the course will examine the
four programming language  paradigms that make  up the current  programming
language landscape. These paradigms are: the imperative paradigm (of  which
traditional programming in,  say, Pascal,  is an  example); the  functional
paradigm,  based  on  the  mathematical  concept  of  function;  the  logic
programming paradigm, based on mathematical logic; and the  object-oriented
paradigm.

<p>This
is a "learning by  doing" course, which means  the work load will be
substantial.  Apart from  the occasional hiatus, there will be an
assignment due each week.

<p>Prerequisite: CmpSci 187; corequisite: CmpSci 250.

<h2>Grading</h2>
Programming  and other Assignments: 30%; Class-tests 30%; Final Exam 40%.

<h2> Textbooks</h2>

Abelson and Sussman, "The Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs".

<p>Extra copies of handouts and assignments will be available in LGRC A243,
and supplementary materials  will be  on reserve in  the Physical  Sciences
Library, second floor, LGRC.

<h2>Class Tests</h2>

This semester your work will be assessed on the basis of (a) the quality of
your project-work, and (b) on your performance in class-tests (c) the final
exam. The class tests will be short tests held without prior notice  during
scheduled class-hours. A make-up test  will only be given for good reason.

<h2>Education Laboratory (EDLAB)</h2>

This is situated at room 225 in the tower. It is open every day from 8:30
am to 11:30 pm.

<p>Your initial password is your student id, unless you already have an
account, in which case you should use your existing password.
You should not use this password after your first login to the system.
The computer may require you to change your password during this login; if
not you should change the password, using the <tt> yppasswd</tt> command

<p>For remote use you will need a PC or Macintosh with a terminal emulator
and modem. The number to dial in is: 545-3700. You should select
1. Computer Science Dept for your option.

<p>
The correct modem settings are 8 bit, 1 stop bit, no parity. If you are
using a modem at more than 9600 baud, you should use <tt>rts-cts</tt>
flow control. You
may need to do:

<pre>
    setenv term = vt100
</pre>

<h2>Submitting Work</h2>

All assignments are submitted by creating  a file in the sub-directory  287
of your account on  the EDLAB. The  name of the file  will be specified  as
part of the assignment, e.g. <tt>"assign1.scm"</tt>. The work will be taken
to have been submitted on time if the date of last modification is the  due
date or earlier. In other words do NOT edit the file AFTER the due date.
If your file is in the wrong directory (say your home directory)
can use the <tt>mv</tt> command in Unix to move it to the class directory
without changing the modification date.

<p>Programming assignments  are  graded  on  a  scale  of  0-10.
Programming assignments submitted late will lose one point on this scale
per 24 hours.


<p>If
you wish to query the grade you receive, you should do this with the  TA
in the first instance.


<h2>Honesty Policy</h2>

This section is an explanation aspects of this class which are relevant
to the interpretation of the Honesty Policy of the
University of Massachusetts.


<p>It is  acceptable  to  discuss assignments  between  yourselves  at  the
algorithmic level, and also to discuss  in general how the capabilities  of
Scheme may  be used  to solve  a given  problem. However  the text  of  any
assignment must be independently composed  by you yourself, apart from
code which is taken from the text of the lecture notes. It is good practice
to delineate clearly such code, which plays the same role as quotations
do in composing English text.

<p>In particular, you must not copy  text generated by another student  and
use it as a basis  for work that you will  submit as your own.

<p>By an "independently composed text" is meant a text that a court of  law
could be expected to regard as being a new piece of intellectual  property.
You may wish to reflect upon the fact that if you become a computer science
professional  you  will  have  to  work  on  creating  systems  for   which
proprietorial rights are absolutely clear. Corporate lawyers are not  known
to be a breed more gentle in their dealings than are professors.

<p>You may not deliberately assist another student by providing him or  her
with the text of a solution to an assignment in any form. [You may wish  to
reflect upon  the advantages  to the  public of  having high  standards  of
professionalism among practitioners of Computer Science. Hospital  patients
may be (and have been) injured by badly implemented software as well as  by
badly trained surgeons. Aircraft and  high-speed trains depend on  software
for their safe functioning. The Computer Science Department has,  acting
under authority delegated to it by the University of Massachusetts, decided
what is  an  appropriate educational  experience  to achieve  a  degree  in
Computer Science. While helping a fellow student to think through the way
to find a solution to a given assignment is an activity that helps create
a well-educated professional body of practitioners, making the solution
available to him or her verbatim degrades professional quality.]

<p>No information  may be  transferred between  students during  the  class
tests  or  final  examination.  To  minimise  the  temptations  involved,
tests and exams will be in general unique to each student.


<p><em> Failure  of  the  course  will be  the  sanction  applied  for  any
violation of  any of  these  rules, and  this rule  has  been and  will  be
rigorously applied.</em> In such circumstances the student has the right to
appeal to the Undergraduate Academic Honesty Board. A written report on the
circumstances of such a failure is required by the University.

<p>Each student should be aware of the danger that another student may copy
his or her work without  his or her knowledge.  To guard against this,  you
should be sure to log off before leaving the EDLAB or other terminal area.


<h2>Honors Section</h2>

The Honors Section will meet at a time to be agreed.

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Note for people with previous Scheme or Lisp experience:
We will use the new IEEE standard Scheme in which <tt> '() </tt>
and <tt> #f </tt> are different.
