<h2> Basic Rules of Inference </h2>

<p>[This owes much to the HOL system]

<p>We said earlier that <tt>Theorem</tt> is a datatype that contains only
"correct" theorems. In this section we consider the basic ways
in which we can construct new theorems. Following HOL we capitalise the
names of the functions which do this.

<p> Recall that each theorem is of the form
<tt><b>premises</b> |- <b>conclusion</b></tt>
where <tt><b>premises</b></tt> is a list of terms, and
<tt><b>conclusion</b></tt> is a term.

<p>What exactly is the nature of theorems, and what's their relation to our
programs? In a way, there is only  an <em>accidental</em> relationship - we
have created  the <tt>Term</tt> datatype that lets us
create objects that <em>resemble</em> those from which our programs are
built. But, unlike classic LISP, there is no built-in <tt>eval</tt>
function that couples these abstract syntactic structures to the execution
mechanism of the language. So  The Language lets us manipulate terms and
theorems whose subject matter is the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus in much
the same way as Mathematica lets us manipulate data-structures whose
subject-matter is algebraic.

<p> However, the <tt>Theorem</tt> datatype acts as a kind of
<em>contract</em> between the language implementor and the language user.
That is to say, if a user can create a theorem which says that his program
should behave in one way, while the program <em>actually</em> behaves in
another, then he has a rock-solid case for going to the implementor and
saying that her implementation is broken. [Readers are invited to
choose a permutation of the genders in the previous sentence to render
it minimally sexist].

<h3> We characterise rules of inference with "vertical productions".</h3>
These indicate how one <em>theorem</em> is to be derived from one or more
others. They typically have the form

<pre>
        theorems_before
        _____________

        theorem_after
</pre>
However this characterisation achieves clarity by the suppression of
detail. Many rules allow us to introduce a statement about an arbitrary
<em>term</em>, which must be specified to make a rule algorithmically
complete.

<p>Rules are realised as functions available in The Language
(but not, primitively, written in it) which typically map
<tt>theorems_before</tt> and some additional member of <tt>Term</tt> into
<tt>theorem_after</tt>.

<p>When we state that the implementation of a rule <em>may</em> raise an
exception, we mean that it is at the discretion of the implementor whether
this is done. In this we differ radically from HOL; in that system type is
integrated closely into the logic. In our case the type-system is simply a
<em>critic</em>.

<h3> Rules which relate to Propositional Logic.</h3>
<p> Our rules fall into various classes. Firstly there are those which
interface between propositional logic and theorems. Now we've stated that a
theorem has the form
<ul>
<tt><b>premises</b> |- <b>conclusion</b></tt>
</ul>
What we may wonder is the difference between this <em>theorem</em> and the
<em>term</em>
<ul>
<tt><b>premises</b> ==> <b>conclusion</b></tt>
</ul>
where <tt>==></tt> is the implication operator of Propositional Logic, as
encoded in our formalism?  It helps to see an analogy here with Linear
Algebra. In Linear Algebra we learnt to treat systems of linear equations
such as
<pre>
        2x + 3y = 10
        3x + 7y = 8
</pre>
using matrices such as
<pre>
       ( 2   3 )
       ( 3   7 )
</pre>
The matrix is a convenient packaging of the original equations for the
purpose of solution. Likewise, the theorem is a convenient packaging of
statements first expressed using the Propositional connectives to say
things about expressions in the  <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus.

<p>
So, our first group of proof-rules form an interface between theorems and
the Propositional Calculus.


<hr>
<h4> Rule 1: We may introduce an assumption </h4>

We may think of this as a way of encoding the tautology <em>t==>t</em>
in theorem form.

<p>ASSUME : Term -> Theorem

<pre>
      __________

        t |- t
</pre>

<tt>ASSUME t</tt> evaluates to the theorem  <tt> t |- t </tt>

<p>For example <tt>ASSUME 'x=2'</tt> evaluates to the theorem
<pre>
    x=2 |- x=2
</pre>

An implementation may raise an exception if the type of <tt>t</tt> in the
current type environment is not <tt>Boolean</tt>.

<hr>
<h4>Rule 2: Discharging an Assumption</h4>

This allows us to perform a step of conversion back from the
<tt>Theorem</tt> form to a Propositional Calculus form. We can remove
a specified term from the premises of a <em>theorem</em> and use it as
the premise of a propositional implication from which the conclusion of the
original theorem follows.

<p><tt>DISCH : Term -> Theorem -> Theorem </tt>

<pre>
                <img src=Gamma.gif>  |-  t<sub>2</sub>
                _________________________

                <img src=Gamma.gif> - {t<sub>1</sub>} |- t<sub>1</sub> ==> t<sub>2</sub>
</pre>

<p>Note that there's no need for <tt>t<sub>1</sub></tt> to be a member
of <img src=Gamma.gif>.  In this case

<pre>   <img src=Gamma.gif>-{t<sub>1</sub>} = <img src=Gamma.gif></pre>

For example <tt>(DISCH  'x=2' (ASSUME 'x=2')) </tt> evaluates to
<ul>
<tt>|- (x=2) ==> (x=2)</tt>
</ul>

<p><tt>(DISCH t<sub>1</sub>)</tt> may raise an exception if
<tt>t<sub>1</sub></tt> is not of type <tt>Boolean</tt> in the current type
environment.

<hr>
<h4>Rule 3: Modus Ponens</h4>

MP: Theorem -> Theorem -> Theorem

<pre>

  <img src=Gamma.gif><sub>1</sub> |- t<sub>1</sub> ==> t<sub>2</sub>        <img src=Gamma.gif><sub>2</sub> |- t<sub>1</sub>
  ___________________________

          <img src=Gamma.gif><sub>1</sub> <img src=cup.gif> <img src=Gamma.gif><sub>2</sub>  |- t<sub>2</sub>

</pre>

Thus <tt>(MP thm1 thm2)</tt> evaluates to a theorem obtained by applying the
Modus Ponens rule as specified above. <tt>MP</tt> raises an exception if
either of its arguments is not a theorem, or if the conclusion of the
first argument is not an implication.

<h3> Rules which specify general facts about equality </h3>

<hr>
<h4> Rule 4: Equality is reflexive </h4>

REFL :  Term -> Theorem

<pre>
    ______________

      |-  t = t
</pre>

<hr>

<h4> Rule 5: Substituting Equal Terms </h4>


SUBST1 : Theorem -> Symbol -> Term -> Theorem -> Theorem

<pre>
    <img src=Gamma.gif><sub>1</sub> |- t<sub>1</sub>=t<sub>2</sub>      <img src=Gamma.gif> t[t<sub>1</sub>]
    ___________________________________

    <img src=Gamma.gif><sub>1</sub>  <img src=cup.gif>  <img src=Gamma.gif>  |- t[t<sub>2</sub>]

</pre>

Here <tt>t[t<sub>1</sub>]</tt> means "a term <tt>t</tt> with some occurrences of
<tt>t<sub>1</sub></tt> singled out (for replacement)".

<p>This is the  most complicated rule.  It embodies the  general notion  that
entities that are <em>equal</em> ought to be interchangeable, so that if,
say, <em>t<sub>1</sub>=t<sub>2</sub></em> then we ought to be able to
replace <em>t<sub>1</sub></em> by <em>t<sub>2</sub></em> in any other
term without changing its meaning. So, for example, if we have a theorem
<tt>  |- x*1 = x </tt>, and we have another theorem

<pre>
    |-  5*(x*1+6) = 5*(x*1) + 5*6
</pre>

then we should be able to conclude that

<pre>
    |- 5*(x*1+6) = 5*x + 5*6
</pre>

Notice that we have only replaced <em>one occurrence</em> of <tt>x*1</tt>
by <tt>x</tt>.

Going back to considering exactly what SUBST1 does, we can say that the
<tt>Symbol</tt> and <tt>Term</tt> arguments support the "singling out"
process. Suppose we call
<pre>
    (SUBST1 thm<sub>1</sub>  v  t<sub>tem</sub>  thm)
</pre>
Where <tt>thm<sub>1</sub></tt> has the form
<tt><img src=Gamma.gif> |- t<sub>1</sub> = t<sub>2</sub> </tt>
and <tt>thm</tt> has the form
<tt><img src=Gamma.gif> |- t </tt>. Then <tt>t<sub>tem</sub></tt> should be equal to
<tt>t</tt> except that certain occurrences of <tt>t<sub>1</sub></tt>
have been replaced by <tt>v</tt> (which variable will not normally
occur  in the theorems). Then <em>exactly those</em> occurrences
of <tt>t<sub>1</sub></tt> which are "marked out" by <tt>v</tt> will be
replaced by <tt>t<sub>2</sub></tt> in the new theorem.

<p>The
<tt>SUBST</tt> rule raises an exception when any of its arguments
fails to have the right form.


<p>[Note - HOL provides a more complicated rule, SUBST. We can write SUBST
using SUBST1, although it will be distinctly less efficient].

<h3> Rules which are  <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus specific.</h3>

The remaining inference-rules encode the  <img src=beta.gif>-reduction
rule and say that the  <img src=lambda.gif>-abstraction of equal terms
gives equal abstractions.

<hr>
<h4> Rule 6: Beta-conversion</h4>

BETA : Term -> Theorem

<pre>
     ____________________________

       |- (\x.E<sub>1</sub>)E<sub>2</sub> = E<sub>1</sub>[x:=E<sub>2</sub>]
</pre>

The argument <tt>t</tt> of <tt>(BETA t)</tt> must have the form of a
<img src=lambda.gif>-abstraction applied to an argument. If so,
<a href = "lambda.html#beta">
<img src=beta.gif>-reduction</a> is performed as specified previously, and
the original and <img src=beta.gif>-reduced forms are equated.

<p>If the term <tt>t</tt> is not a <img src=beta.gif>-redux [i.e. is not of
the form specified] an exception is raised.

<p>For example: <tt> (BETA '(\x. 5+x) 20') </tt> evaluates to
<pre>
    |-  (\x. 5+x) 20 = 5 + 20
</pre>

<hr>
<h4> Rule 7: Abstraction </h4>

ABS : Symbol -> Theorem -> Theorem

<p>The abstraction rule allows us infer the the equality of
abstractions
from the equality of terms.


<pre>
             <img src=Gamma.gif> |- t<sub>1</sub> = t<sub>2</sub>
        _________________________

        <img src=Gamma.gif> |- (\x. t<sub>1</sub>) = (\x. t<sub>2</sub>)
</pre>

<p>Provided <tt>x</tt> does not occur free in <tt><img src=Gamma.gif></tt></p>
</pre>

Example:  <tt> ABS 'x' (REFL 'v') </tt> evaluates to
<pre>
        |- \x.v = \x.v
</pre>

The call
<tt>(ABS v)</tt>  raises an exception if <tt>v</tt> occurs free
in any assumption in <tt><img src=Gamma.gif></tt>.

<hr>

<h2>But We Build Mightily Upon These Rules</h2>

<p>The above inference rules are the "<tt>car, cdr, cons</tt> of
program verification. The list-constructors of LISP and its
descendants <em>police</em> the use  of memory so that users can't
create illegal structures (pointers to nowhere etc.) However one
doesn't (or shouldn't) write programs that create complex
data-structures using just <tt>car, cdr, cons</tt>, but should instead
create levels of abstraction using these primitives.

<p>Likewise we are free to write functions that manipulate theorems
knowing that the only theorems we can <em>create</em> are
provably correct (since we can create a proof of any theorem from the
system axioms by following the sequences of inference-rule
applications).

<h3> Looking inside theorems </h3>
In fact the proof-rules are in effect abstract <em>constructors</em>
for theorems, and play the role of  <tt>cons</tt> in LISP. There's no
harm in <em>looking</em> inside a theorem. This is supported as
follows:

<pre>
Theorem.? : Top->Boolean           Recognises if an object
                                   is a theorem

Theorem.hyp : Theorem->List(Term)  Extracts the list of
                                   hypotheses

Theorem.concl: Theorem->Term       Extracts the conclusion

Theorem.history: Theorem->History  Extracts the inference history of
                                   the theorem.

Theorem.add_history:               Makes a new theorem with an
        Theorem->History->Theorem  appropriate history.
</pre>

The "<tt>add_history</tt>" capability calls for comment. It is an
exception to the rule that users can only create theorems using
proof-methods. In effect, it allows a user to rewrite the history
of a theorem. While this may appear to have Stalinist potential, it
primarily serves to allow <em>useful</em> histories to be created by
higher-level theorem-manipulating functions. The inference-rules
operate at a very fine grain, and it makes sense for higher level
functions to be able to suppress details of this fine-grain operation
in the historical record.

<h3> Writing a Derived Inference Rule </h3>

As an example, let's write a new inference rule,

<pre>
    ADD_ASSUME : Term -> Theorem -> Theorem
</pre>

<tt>(ADD_ASSUME t<sub>1</sub> thm)</tt> simply adds the (redundant)
assumption <tt>t<sub>1</sub></tt> to the existing assumptions of the
theorem. So it embodies a new rule:

<pre>
       <img src=Gamma.gif> |-  t
    ______________

    <img src=Gamma.gif>, t<sub>1</sub>  |- t
</pre>

We can realise this rule with the following definition:

<pre>
Definition ADD_ASSUME =
    \ t1 thm.                       ;;; thm = G |- t, say
        let thm1 = ASSUME t1,       ;;; t1 |- t1
            thm2 = DISCH t1 thm,    ;;; G  |- t1==>t
        in
            MP thm2 thm1            ;;; G,t1 |- t
        endlet
End;
</pre>
