We Can Systematically Reduce Expressions to Normal Form


</center>

<h2>Doing reduction systematically</h2>

The <em><img src=beta.gif>, <img src=eta.gif></em>
and <img src=delta.gif>-reductions
which
we have considered  can, in  general, be applied  in various  places in  an
expression.  Consider,  for   example:  <em>(<img  src=lambda.gif>   x.(+ 1
x))((<img src=lambda.gif>  x.x)2)</em>.  This  can be  reduced  using  <img
src=beta.gif>- reduction to <em>(<img src=lambda.gif> x.(+ 1 x))2</em>  or
to <em>+ 1  ((<img src=lambda.gif> x.x)2)</em>.  Another stage of <img
src=beta.gif>- reduction arrives at <em>+ 1 2</em> in both cases. In  this
section we ask `does it matter where we chose to do the reduction'.

If <em>E</em> is an expression of <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus then a  <em>
redex</em> is a
sub-expression of <em>E</em> which can be reduced by one of our rules.






<h3>Choice of Redex is vital for Y</h3>
A close look at our definition of the Y-combinator indicates that its very
mode of letting the recursion genie out of the bottle makes the choice of
redex important.  A simplified version of <em>Y</em> illustrates our difficulty:

<ul>(<img src=lambda.gif> x. x x)(<img src=lambda.gif> x.x x)
 <img src=longrightarrow.gif><sub><img
src=beta.gif></sub>
(<img src=lambda.gif> x. x x)(<img src=lambda.gif> x.x x)
</ul>
Thus, this <em><img src=lambda.gif></em> expression can be rewritten forever to itself using
<img src=beta.gif>-reduction.  Worse, consider:

<ul>(<img src=lambda.gif> x. x x x)(<img src=lambda.gif> x.x x x)
 <img src=longrightarrow.gif><sub><img
src=beta.gif></sub>
(<img src=lambda.gif> x. x x x)(<img src=lambda.gif> x.x x x)(<img src=lambda.gif> x.x x x)
</ul>

here we have a <em><img src=lambda.gif></em> expression that gets bigger and bigger every time
it is rewritten. It should not surprise us that we might have difficulty in
telling whether a sequence of  reductions in the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus will terminate. If the
<img src=lambda.gif>-calculus is powerful enough to be a general purpose programming language, then
it is powerful enough

<p>
If <em> <img src=longrightarrow.gif></em> is a relation, then we say that
<em> <img src=longrightarrow.gif><sup>*</sup></em>
is the
transitive and reflexive closure of <em> <img src=longrightarrow.gif></em>.
The * is often called
the Kleene Star operation, after the mathematician Kleene.

<p>
Formally, <em> <img src=longrightarrow.gif><sup>*</sup>x</em>,
and if <em>x <img src=longrightarrow.gif>
y</em> and <em>y <img src=longrightarrow.gif><sup>*</sup>z</em>
then <em>x <img src=longrightarrow.gif><sup>*</sup> z</em>.

<p>
Our reduction rules can be turned into <em> conversion rules</em> by taking the
symmetric closure.

  <ul>E<sub>1</sub> <img src=converts.gif> E<sub>2</sub>
iff   E<sub>1</sub> <img src=longrightarrow.gif>  E<sub>2</sub>  or
      E<sub>2</sub> <img src=longrightarrow.gif>  E<sub>1</sub></ul>


<p>
Now we have shown that <em> <img src=longrightarrow.gif><sup>*</sup></em>
is an <em> infinite relation</em>, since
we have exhibited a series of  `reductions' a each step of which we obtain
a bigger expression \ref{blowup}. In navigating this infinite maze of
reduction, is there any guiding light, and can we recover if we take a
wrong turn? The answers are ``Yes! and Yes!'', as is shown by the
following:

<a name = "normal"> </a>
<h3>Normal Forms</h3>

An expression <em>E</em> of the <img  src=lambda.gif>-calculus is said to be  in
<em> normal form</em> if there is no expression <em>E'</em> for which  <em>E<img
src=longrightarrow.gif> E'</em>.

<h4> Choices for where to apply reduction rules</h4>
<p>For example</p>
<ul>
    (+ (+ 4 5) (* 8 3))
</ul>
<p>might be reduced to</p>
<ul>
    (+ 9 (* 8 3))
</ul>
<p>or to</p>
<ul>
(+ (+ 4 5) 24)
</ul>

<h4>Church Rosser Theorem I</h4>

<!--     OOPs take this out
<p>Moreover in this case <em>u <img src=in.gif> FV(F) </em>, so that
the <em>u</em> taken away in the set subtraction is put back by the
union. Thus we have</p>

<ul>FV(G[u:=w][x:=F]) =
  (FV(G)-{x}) <img src=cup.gif> FV(F)  <img src=cup.gif> {w}
</ul>
-->

If <em>E<sub>1</sub> <img src=converts_star.gif>
E<sub>2</sub></em> then there exists an expression <em>E</em> such that
  <em>E<sub>1</sub> <img src=reduces_star.gif>
E</em>  and <em>E<sub>2</sub><img src=reduces_star.gif> E</em>

<b> Corollary:</b> A normal form for an expression is unique.


The strategy of always choosing to reduce the leftmost outermost redex
first always produces a normal form if one exists. This is called normal
order reduction.

<h4>Church Rosser Theorem II</h4>
If <em>E<sub>1</sub><img src=reduces_star.gif>
E<sub>2</sub></em> and <em>E<sub>2</sub></em> is a normal form, then normal order
reduction will always result in reduction to <em>E<sub>2</sub></em>.


<p>
This result is of great importance to the design of programming languages
because  it implies that the vast majority of programming languages
(including Scheme and ML) are <em> wrong</em>!, because they do not use a
normal order reduction. A small set of languages, of which Haskell is the
most important, do use normal order reduction, or reductions that are
provably equivalent to it.


<h2> Equality of Expressions in the Lambda Calculus </em>

When mathematicians are faced with a collection <em>X</em> of things that
"ought" to be the same but are different on the surface, they have a standard
approach to creating the system that they really want - essentially they
partition <em>X</em> into <em> equivalence classes</em>, putting all things that
ought to be the same as each other in the same equivalence class.

<p> For example the fraction-forms   3/4 and 6/8  ought to be the same but are
constructed differently. So when we build the <em>rational numbers</em> we
require each rational number to be a class of fraction-forms equivalent under
the relation  <em>p/q  == r/s</em>  iff  <em>ps=qr</em>.

<p> For this to work correctly, the  relation which formally encodes "ought to
be the same" must be an <em>equivalence relation</em>, that is to say it must be
reflexive, symetric and transitive.

<p>There is an additional requirement that applies to any operations that we
want to define on the rationals, such as addition or multiplication. If these
are to  be <em>functions</em>, then we have to show that

        6/8 + 2/14  == 3/4 + 1/7
