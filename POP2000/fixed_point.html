        Recursion in the Lambda Calculus


</center>

<h2>The fixed-point combinator lets us recurse</h2>

<p>
A programming language has to allow us, in some sense, to perform an action
repeatedly. In imperative languages you will have met constructs like <tt>
while</tt>
and {\bf for} loops. It is not immediately apparent that the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus has
equivalent power, but it does!

<p>
Let us suppose we have an operator <em>Y</em>
which acts upon expressions of the
<img src=lambda.gif>-calculus according to the rule

<ul>YE = E(YE)</ul>

<h3> Doing the factorial function with <em>Y</em> </h3>

<p>
Consider the expression

<ul>F =  <img src=lambda.gif> u. <img src=lambda.gif> x. (if (= x 0) 1 (* x (u(- x 1))))</ul>

<p>
For some variable <em>n</em>

<ul>(YF) n = (F(YF)) n</ul>

<p>
using <em><img src=beta.gif></em>-reduction we obtain:

<ul> = (<img src=lambda.gif> x. if (= x 0) 1 (* x (YF (- x 1)))) n</ul>


again using <em><img src=beta.gif></em>-reduction we obtain:

<ul> = if (= n 0) 1 (* n (YF (- n 1)))</ul>

that is to say, <em>YF</em>
satisfies the equation usually given for the factorial
function

<ul>fact(n) = if  n=0  then  1  else  n*fact(n-1)</ul>

<h3> <em>YE</em> is a fixed point of E</h3>

<p>
We say that <em>YE</em>  is a <em> fixed  point</em> of <em>E</em>, and  we
call <em>Y</em> a  <em> fixpoint combinator</em>.[There  is an  interesting
analogy in linear algebra - let <em>\cal E</em>
be a function which  returns
the eigenvectors of  a matrix. Then
<em>A(\cal E A)  \equiv \cal E A</em>,
where vectors  are  equivalent  if  they  have  the  same  direction.  Thus
eigenvectors are a fixed point of the matrix. Indeed, if we take
<em>A</em>
to be a linear function  over projective space, then  \cal E is a  fixpoint
combinator in the same sense as <em>Y</em>]


<h3>Working out the factorial function</h3>
For an exercise, let us evaluate <em>YF</em> for a few natural numbers:

<ul>YF(0) =  if (= 0 0) 1 (* 0 (YF (- 0 1)))</ul>
<ul>  =    if true 1 (* 0 (YF (- 0 1)))</ul>
<ul> = 1 </ul>


<ul>YF(1) =  if (= 1 0) 1 (* 1 (YF (- 1 1)))</ul>
<ul>  =    if false 1 (* 1 (YF (- 1 1)))</ul>
<ul> =      (* 1 (YF (- 1 1)) </ul>
<ul> =      (* 1 (YF 0)) </ul>
<ul> =      (* 1 1) </ul>
<ul> =        1 </ul>


<ul>YF(2) =  if (= 2 0) 2 (* 2 (YF (- 2 1)))</ul>
<ul>  =    if false 1 (* 2 (YF (- 2 1)))</ul>
<ul> =      (* 2 (YF (- 2 1)) </ul>
<ul> =      (* 2 (YF 1)) </ul>
<ul> =      (* 2 1) </ul>
<ul> =        2 </ul>

<h4>But we have freedom in where to reduce</h4>
Note that <em> where chose to apply our reduction rules</em> is significant
in working out <em>YF</em>.
For example, we could have chosen to expand using
<em>YF = F(YF)</em>,
and gone on forever. In the next section we will consider
reduction strategies.

<h4>We can define <em>Y</em> in <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus!</h4>
Up to now we have supposed that <em>Y</em> is an operator that we have made
available as an addition to the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus. But it is not! We can define it as an
expression in the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus:

<ul> Y = (<img src=lambda.gif> h. (<img src=lambda.gif> x.h (x x)) (<img src=lambda.gif> x.h (x x)))</ul>

It is left as an exercise to the reader to verify that, for any expression
<em>E</em> of the <img src=lambda.gif>-calculus, YE = E(YE), where Y is defined as above.
