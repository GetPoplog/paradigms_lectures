The material on linear processes is discussed in section 1.2, [p.31ff.].
This includes the computation of the factorial function and of Fibonacci
numbers.

<h2>Iterative Processes and Tail Recursion</h2>


<p>
A computational process is "the pattern of actions a computing device takes".
A program directs these actions.

Let's compare the following definitions of the factorial function:

<pre><code>
(define (factorial n)
   (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
(define (fact_iter n product)
    (if (= n 0) product
        (fact_iter (- n 1) (* n product) )
        )
    )
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
(define (fact_1 n) (fact_iter n 1))
</code></pre>

<p> Both  are  recursive functions.  factorial  is a  <em>linear  recursive
process</em>, that is, there are  deferred computations that grow  linearly
in <tt>n</tt>.

<p> <tt>fact_1</tt> is an <em>iterative process</em>. there are no deferred
computations. It is a linear iterative process.

<p> A function,  written recursively, is  an <em>iterative process</em>  if
each recursive call occurs at the <em>top level of a conditional</em>. This
arises from  the  fact  there  is  no  need  to  defer  a  computation,  or
alternatively, the working-space  to hold  the values of  variables can  be
reused.

Consider:

<pre>
    (factorial 4)
    ==> (* 4 (factorial 3))
    ==> (* 4 (* 3 (factorial 2)))
    ==> (* 4 (* 3 (* 2  (factorial 1))))
    ==> (* 4 (* 3 (* 2  1)))
    ==> 24
</pre>

<p>
because the recursive calls of factorial are nested inside a computation, we
have to remember what that computation was in order to carry on with it.

<p>
On the other hand, with:

<pre>
    (fact_1 4))
    ==> (fact_iter 4 1)
    ==> (fact_iter 3 4)
    ==> (fact_iter 2 12)
    ==> (fact_iter 1 24)
    ==> (fact_iter 0 24)
    ==> 24
</pre>

<p>
the apparently recursive calls are not nested, do there is no need to
remember what we were doing, and we can re-use the same space.

<h2><a name = "proof">A proof that fact_iter produces the same result as
factorial</a></h2>


<p> This proof assumes that the  Scheme objects which represent numbers  do
in fact behave like numbers, so that for example <tt>(* x 1) = x</tt>.
For Scheme integers this  is a reasonable assumption,  since as we  recall,
they are of arbitrary precision.

<h4>Theorem</h4>
For all integers <tt>n>=0, (factorial n) = (fact_iter n 1)</tt>

<p> Discussion. This theorem  relates the functions <tt>factorial</tt>  and
<tt>fact_1</tt>. However the  work of  computing the factorial  is done  by
<tt>fact_iter</tt>. So, in  order to prove  this theorem, we  are going  to
have to  prove  something  about <tt>fact_iter</tt>,  and,  since  it  is a
recursive function, we are going to have to prove it by induction. The most
obvious thing we might try to prove is that


<pre>
       (fact_iter n 1)  = (factorial n)
</pre>

<p> However this clearly is not going to work, since in the computation  of
<tt>(fact_iter n  1)</tt> for  a  given <tt>n</tt>  we  are going  to  call
<tt>(fact_iter  i  j)</tt>  where  <tt>i</tt>  ranges  from  <tt>1</tt>  to
<tt>n</tt> and <tt>j</tt> ranges from <tt>1</tt> to <tt>(factorial n)</tt>.
So we need to prove something more complicated. Well, it we think about it,
<tt>(fact_iter n m)</tt> is going to multiply <tt>m</tt> by <tt>n, (- n  1)
(- n  2) .....  1,</tt>  that is  it is  going  to multiply  <tt>m</tt>  by
<tt>(factorial n)</tt>. So we can formulate the following lemma (a lemma is
a theorem whose main purpose  is to support the  proof of a more  important
theorem  -   just  as   <tt>fact_iter</tt>  is   a  helper   function   for
<tt>fact_1</tt> so our lemma is a "helper-theorem".

<p>
<h4>Lemma:</h4>
For all integers <tt>n>=0, m>=0</tt>

<pre>
(fact_iter n m) = (* (factorial n) m)
</pre>

<p>
    Proof: by induction on n

<p>
    Base case: n=0

<pre>
         (fact_iter 0 m) = m = (* (factorial 0) m)
</pre>

<p>
    Inductive Step:
      Suppose for some k, all m

<pre>
        (fact_iter k m) = (* (factorial k) m)
</pre>

<pre>
      Consider: (fact_iter (+ k 1) m)
    = (fact_iter k (* (+ k 1) m))       by definition of fact_iter
    = (* (factorial k) (* (+ k 1) m))   by inductive hypothesis
    = (* (* (factorial k) (+ k 1)) m)   by associativity
    = (* (factorial (+ k 1)) m)         by definition of factorial
                                            and commutativity of *
</pre>

      So the result holds for <tt>(+ k 1)</tt>

<p>
    Hence by induction, the result holds for all m.
    Hence the Lemma holds.

<p>
Proof of Theorem:

<pre>
    (fact_1 n) = (fact_iter n 1)    by definition of fact_1
    = (* (factorial n) 1)           by Lemma
    = (factorial n)                 by rules of algebra.
</pre>


<p>
[Note, here is a proof of the inductive step in a notation closer to the
traditional mathematical notation]

<p>
Suppose for some k, all m   fact_iter(k,m) = k!*m

<p>
Consider:

<p>

<pre>
fact_iter(k+1,m)
    = fact_iter(k, (k+1)*m)      by definition of fact_iter
    = k! * ((k+1) * m)           by inductive hypothesis
    = (k! * (k+1)) * m           by associativity of multiplication
    = (k+1)! * m                 by definition of factorial, commutativity
                                 of multiplication.
</pre>


<h2><a name = "auto_proof">Automation of such proofs</a></h2>


<p>
The proof above is quite capable of being automated. The hard part is guessing
the right lemma, and that may require human intervention.



<h2><a name = "fib">
The Fibonacci Numbers - A simple definition gives exponential complexity
</a></h2>

<p>
The Fibonacci numbers are a well known sequence of numbers:

<pre>
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,...
</pre>

<p> The first two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1.

<p>
Each Fibonacci number (after the second) is the sum of the two preceding
Fibonacci numbers. We can quite easily write a function to compute the n'th
Fibonnaci number using this property:


<pre><code>
(define (fib n)
    (if (&lt n 2)
        n
        (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))
        )
    )
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we are counting from zero, so
<pre>
    (fib 0) = 0
    (fib 1) = 1
    (fib 2) = 2
...
</p>


<p>
However, consider the calculation:

<pre>
    (fib 5)
    ==> (+ (fib 4) (fib 3))
    ==> (+ (+ (fib 3) (fib 2))  (+ (fib 2) (fib 1)))
    ==> (+ (+ (+ (fib 2) (fib 1)) (+ (fib 1) (fib 0)))
                           (+ (+ (fib 1) (fib 0)) 1))

    ==> (+ (+ (+ (+ (fib 1) (fib 0)) 1) (+ 1 0))
                           (+ (+ 1 0) 1))

    ==> (+ (+ (+ (+ 1 0) 1) (+ 1 0))
                           (+ (+ 1 0) 1))

    ==> 5
</pre>


<p> Observe: At each stage we are <em>doubling</em> the number of  deferred
computations, so  that  to  calculate <tt>(fib  n)</tt>  we  would  perform
<em>2<sup>n</sup></em> deferred computations.

<p>
Also: We are recalculating <tt>(fib n)</tt> for each <tt>n</tt> many times.

<p> We can recast this computation in iterative form by building up the
sequence of Fibonacci numbers successively from the beginning until we have
reached the one we need. This clearly takes <tt>n</tt> operations. We will
need only to remember two successive Fibonacci numbers at each stage. We
use two accumulators which are <tt>(fib (- n 1))</tt> and <tt>(fib (- n
2))</tt>.

<pre>
(define (fib_it n acc1 acc2)
    (if (= n 1) acc2
        (fib_it (- n 1) acc2 (+ acc1 acc2))
        )
    )
</pre>

<p>
And now we can define <tt>fib_2</tt>
which uses <tt>fib_it</tt> as a helper function to compute
the <tt>n</tt>'th Fibonacci number:

<pre>
(define (fib_2 n)
    (if (= n 0) 0
        (fib_it n 0 1)
        )
    )
</pre>

<p>
Consider the evaluation of:


<pre>
  (fib_2 5)
==> (fib_it 5 0 1)
==> (fib_it 4 1 1)
==> (fib_it 3 1 2)
==> (fib_it 2 2 3)
==> (fib_it 1 3 5)
==> 5
</pre>

<p>  We   could   also  improve   the   performance  of   <tt>fib</tt>   by
<em>memoisation</em>, which will be discussed later in the course. This  is
quite painless for the progammer:

<pre>
    (define fib (memoise fib))
</pre>

<p>
and can achieve <em>O(n log(n))</em>
complexity, not quite as good as the O(n)
complexity of the iterative reformulation above, but it involves no recasting
of the original algorithm.




<h2><a name="currying">Currying allows arguments to be specified one at a
time.</a></h2>


<p>
In Scheme, a function with <tt>n</tt>
arguments must be given all its arguments if it
is to work correctly.


<pre><code>
(define curried_+
    (lambda (m)
        (lambda (n) (+ m n))))
</code></pre>


<pre><code>
(define add_2 (curried_+ 2))
(define add_3 (curried_+ 3))
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
(add_2 56)  ==> 58
(add_3 4)   ==> 7
</code></pre>


<p>
Note - we are forced into this definition of <tt>curried_+</tt>
by the peculiarities of
Scheme. The Haskell language, named after Haskell Curry, makes no distinction
between the curried and un-curried forms. Neither does the lambda calculus.
POP-11 provides an intermediate capability - for example
<tt>maplist(%sqrt%)</tt>
is the POP-11 version of the <tt>map</tt>
function with the <tt>sqrt</tt> function curried in,
that is <tt> maplist(%sqrt%)</tt>
will map a list of numbers into their square-roots.



<h2>
<a name = "apply"> The <tt>apply</tt> function</a></h2>

<p>
Scheme has a built-in function <tt>apply</tt>.  This is defined so that:

<pre>
      (apply f x1 x2....xn l)
</pre>

<p>
is equivalent to

<pre>
       (f x1 x2.....xn l1 l2 .. lm))
</pre>

<p>
where <tt>l1 .. lm</tt> are the elements of the list <tt>l</tt>.

<pre>
(example '(apply + 3 4 5 '()) 12)
</pre>

<pre>
(example '(apply + '(3 4 5)) 12)
</pre>
