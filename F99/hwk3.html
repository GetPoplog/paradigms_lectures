Recall that the polynomial function <tt>p</tt> for which
<pre>
    p(x) =  a<sub>0</sub> +  a<sub>1</sub> x +  a<sub>2</sub> x<sup>2</sup> ... a<sub>n</sub> x<sup>n</sup>
</pre>
can be represented by the Scheme list

<pre>
    (a<sub>0</sub> a<sub>1</sub> a<sub>2</sub> ... a<sub>n</sub>)
</pre>


<hr>

<p>(1) Write a function <tt>lam_poly</tt> for which the application
<tt>(lam_poly p)</tt> produces a lambda-expression that is
the definition of the polynomial-function as a Scheme function

<p>Below is a possible example - you may produce a solution that
is more or less optimised than it, as long as it is correct.

<pre>
    (example
        '(lam_poly '(3 4 5))
        '(lambda (x) (+ 3 (* 4 (expt x 1)) (* 5 (expt x 2))
</pre>

</hrule>

<hr>

(2)
The built-in Scheme function <tt>eval</tt> provides a way of compiling
a Scheme expression. The call:

<pre>
  (eval expr (nearest-repl/environment))
</pre>
will evaluate an expression in the "current environment". For example:

  (eval '(+ 2 3) (nearest-repl/environment))

evaluates to 5.

<p>Write a function <tt>fun_poly</tt> for which the application
<tt>(fun_poly p)</tt> produces a Scheme procedure object

<pre>
    (example
        '((fun_poly '(3 4 5)) 2)
         (+ 3 (* 4 (expt 2 1)) (* 5 (expt 2 2)))
    )
</pre>

[Note that from Naomi Nag's point of view, this is a level-1 problem.]

<hr>



(3) The Newton-Raphson method for the iterative solution of  non-linear
equations makes use of the equation

<pre>
    f(x+t) = f(x) + t f'(x) + e  ------------------- (1)
</pre>
where  f'  denotes the derivative of  f  and  e is an error term
quadratic in t [for analytic functions]. Setting
<pre>
    f(x+t) = 0
</pre>
we obtain
<pre>
    t = -f(x)/f'(x)  - e/f'(x)  -------------------- (2)
</pre>


We can use (2) as a basis for improving a approximate solution
x<sub>i</sub> of f(x) = 0 to a better solution  x<sub>i+1</sub> by

<pre>
    x<sub>i+1</sub> =  x<sub>i </sub>- f(x)/f'(x)
</pre>

Write a Scheme function <tt>solve_poly</tt> for which the application
<tt>(solve_poly  p x0 eps)</tt> will evaluate to an approximation to
a root of the polynomial equation <tt> p = 0 </tt>
provided that  <tt>x0</tt>
is sufficiently close to a root of p.  The parameter <tt>eps</tt>
is used to determine the accuracy of the root - you should regard
a solution as adequate when

<pre>
    abs(x<sub>i+1</sub> -  x<sub>i </sub>) < eps
</pre>

Do not forget that you should use floating point contagion to
ensure that your program doesn't try to produce a rational
answer (which if correct, would be produced slowly, and wouldll be
meaningless to the average user).

<p> The simplest example should converge in one iteration:
<pre>
 (solve_poly '(1 1) 0 0.000001)
</pre>
to give the root -1.0

<pre>
    (solve_poly '(1 0 -1) 0.5 0.000001)
</pre>
Should give the root 1.0  (approximately) while

<pre>
    (solve_poly '(1 0 -1) -0.5 0.000001)
</pre>

Should give the root -1.0.

Finally, to get serious, try to find the roots of the polynomial
defined by the Scheme list
<pre>
    '(2 -1 2 1)
</pre>
