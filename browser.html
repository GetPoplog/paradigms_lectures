<h1> The SuperScheme Browser. </h1>

<hr>
<p> This program is intended solely for displaying the 287 course material.
It makes use of the VED editor to display <tt>.html</tt> files to the  best
of VED's limited  ability. It  works by taking  a ".html"  source file  and
creating a temporary ".htmlo" file which is then displayed by VED.

<p>Hyperlinks appear in underlined  blue text as in  Netscape. Like
this:<br> <a href = "index.html">Back to the index</a>

<p>But the  browser doesn't remember that you have visited a particular
one.

<p>You can't change the text as displayed by the browser by typing  (unless
your username is "pop").  You can, however, copy  it into your programs  in
the usual  way. Note  that  you can  actually  <em>cut</em> text.  This  is
inadvisable, since the hyperlinks  will cease to  work for that  particular
buffer.

<p>Information that is intended to be regarded as <em>program text</em>
will appear in <tt>red</tt>.

<h2> Limitations </h2>

<p>
(1) Only a single font, and its variants (coloured, underscore, bold  etc.)
are  available  to  VED.  So  headers  are  indicated  by  an   underlining
convention.

<p>
(2) Figures can only be displayed by the "xv" program in a separate window.
To get rid  of a  figure, use  the right  mouse button  to pull  up the  xv
control panel, and select "quit".

<p>
(3) Tables  are not  implemented,  neither are  certain forms  of  indented
lists.

<p>
(4) The browser is much more particular  about (some of) the rules of  HTML
than is Netscape.  It puts  a "BAD  HTML..." message  in the  output if  it
doesn't like what the author has done.

<p>
(5) I haven't implemented comments correctly. A comment must have the form

<pre>
        &lt;!-- XXXXXXX -->
</pre>

<p>
with a space after the first "--".

<p>
If I have time, I'll adapt it  for browsing more widely, but (sigh!)  don't
expect to make inroads into Netscape's profits...


<p>
(6) See the above-mentioned ability to change the <tt>.htmlo</tt> text by
cutting or pasting into the text. This WILL upset the hyperlink following
mechanism

<p>
(7) Information about the hyperlinks etc. is appended to the end of the
<tt>.htmlo</tt> file. Currently this is left in place in the edit buffer,
though the intention is to crop it off.


<p>(8) Only one hyperlink per line of text is permitted. And it should not
be integrated with other text.
