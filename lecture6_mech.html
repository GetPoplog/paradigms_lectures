     Abstraction in Engineering

[under development]

<hr>

<p>The
need for abstraction is not confined to Computer Science, or Computer
Engineering. Let's consider, for example, a boat. Each component of a boat
can be specified at an abstract level in which a great deal of detail is
hidden.

For example, in a boat (equipped with auxiliary power) the
concept of an <em>alternator</em> is an abstraction. In essence an
alternator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. This is the
most abstract specification. However for practical purposes a more detailed
specification is required, which states what the mechanical and electrical
interfaces are.

<p>Likewise


<p>The performance penalty incurred in using a given interface can be seen
if we consider the V-belt drive. This is an easy mechanical interface to
meet, but the efficiency and torque-transmission capabilities are small
compared with (say) a gear transmission.
