<h2>Mutating Data-Structures in Scheme </h2>

<p>
As well as <tt>set!</tt>
which,  as we have seen, is  a <em>special form</em> which provides  an
assignment statment, there are two  built-in procedures in Scheme which  allow
data-structures already built to be changed.

<ul>
<li>
    <tt>(set-car!
list expr)</tt>  evaluates <tt>expr</tt>
and assigns the resulting value to be
    the <tt>car</tt>  of the <tt>list</tt>.
<li>
    <tt>(set-cdr!
list expr)</tt> evaluates <tt>expr</tt>
and assigns the resulting value to be
    the <tt>cdr</tt> of <tt>list</tt>
</ul>

<p>
These operations are equivalent to the  operations of assigning to the  fields
of a record in Pascal or the fields of a structure in C. The original value of
the <tt>list</tt>
ceases to  exist. We  speak  of such  operations as  being  <em>mutation
operations</em>.

<p>
Consider now the following:

<pre><code>
(define list '(5 6 7))
(define list1 list)



(example '(eq? list list1) #t)

(set-car! list 'fred

(example 'list '(fred 6 7))
(example 'list1 '(fred 6 7))
(example '(eq? list list1) #t)
</code></pre>


<p>
What happens if we do:

<pre><code>
 (set-cdr! list list)
</code></pre>


<h2>  A note on persistence </h2>


<p>
The term <em>persistent</em>
is used in Computer Science in two different ways.

<h3>  Persistence across updates </h3>


<p>
(1) In the theoretical discussion data-structures <em>persistent</em>
is a property  of
the preservation of the original structure after some state-changing operation
has been done on it. For example, the <tt>adjoin</tt>
operation on sets represented  as
trees is commonly  defined in  the imperative  paradigm as  an operation  that
destroys the  original tree.  In this  context <em>persistence</em>
is defined  to  be
concerned with the preservation or restoration of the original structure after
the update has been made.

In general, the ability to reverse changes that may have been made erroneously
to data-structures is a very important one.

Note that the <em>functional
paradigm</em> provides persistence automatically. Consider
the Scheme expression:

<pre>
   (list set (adjoin 23 set))
</pre>

This contains both the original set, and  the set with the number 23  adjoined
to it. The tree representation of sets requires us to use O(log n) space  each
time we adjoin  an element, which  means that it  is quite cheap  to keep  old
copies around.

<h3> Persistence across processes</h3>

<p>
In almost all applications of computing it is vital that some data continue to
past the lifetime of the process that created it. The term
<em>persistent</em>
is  also
used to describe such data. Most computer languages provide direct support for
only one kind of persistent data, the <em>file</em>.


<p>
<em>Persistent
programming languages</em>,  for example PS-Algol or Napier,
take a more  radical
view  -  any  data-structure  can  potentially  persist.  We  say  that,  in a
persistent programming  language,  persistence  is <em> orthogonal</em>
to  all
 other
properties of data-structures.

<p>
Scheme, defined by the IEEE standard, provides an intermediate approach  to
persistence - almost all Scheme data-structures can be written to a file by
the <tt>print</tt>  function in  a form  in  which they  can be  read  back
<tt>read</tt> function.

<p>
To be practical,  a persistent  language requires  data-structures to  have
attributes that  are  usually  associated with  files,  for  example  every
data-structure will need to be <em>owned</em> by some real or notional <em>
user</em>. It must  be possible to  <em>lock</em> a data-structure  while a
complex update operation is performed upon it.



<h2>  "Dotted Pairs" and improper lists </h2>



<p>
Up to now, we have always used <tt>cons</tt>
in such a way that the second argument is
a list. Scheme does not actually require us to do so. We can easily check out
what happens:

<pre><code>
(define l (cons 2 3))
</code></pre>

This prints as:

<pre>
    (2 . 3)
</pre>

<p>
Such an entity  is called  a "dotted  pair". We also  speak of  it forming  an
<em>improper
list</em>. A list-structure is proper  if all rightmost elements of  every
sub-structure are <tt>'()</tt>. The following list is improper

<pre><code>
     '(2 3 4 . 5)
</code></pre>

<p>
As is this:

<pre><code>
    '(2 3 (5 . 7) 9)
</code></pre>

<p>
It is always true that (cdr (cons a b)) = b, whether b is a list or not.



<h2> The machine-level representation of data in Scheme </h2>

<p>
In an implementation  of Scheme, the  entities that you  can define in  the
language must be represented  in the actual computer.  Scheme data is  <em>
self describing</em>, that  is the  computer must be  able to  tell of  any
particular datum whether  it is  a number, symbol,  pair, string,  boolean,
empty-list etc...  This  is  usually  achieved  by  an  approach  in  which
data-entities are <em>tagged</em> in various ways to indicate their type.

<p>
A possible approach to tagging is described below. It is a simplified version
of the one used in the Poplog system.


<ul>
<li>
(a) Small integers are represented by machine integers combined with a
  1-bit tag.

<li>
(b) All other entities are represented by an address of a block of store
  in which the entity is stored. This block begins with a tag which indicates
  the type of the stored entity.

</ul>

<p>
Each entity in Scheme is thus referred to by a fixed-length bit-pattern, which
apart from the case of short integers (and possibly short floats) is a pointer
to a  structure. This  is normally  large enough  to address  anywhere in  the
virtual memory of a process, and so is commonly 32-bits, but is 64 bits on the
DEC Alpha architecture, and on some others.

<p>
The convention used in  Poplog is:<br>

<IMG SRC = "heap0.jpg">


<p>
This assumes byte-addressing,  so that addresses  of word-aligned blocks  have
the form 4*n. Hence small integers and addresses can be distinguished. Integer
addition takes one extra operation, to remove the tag-bit.

<p>
In this system, a  <tt>pair</tt>
is represented  by the address of  a 3-field block  of
store. The first  field is a  tag which  indicates that the  stored item  is a
pair, the second holds the <tt>car</tt>
value  and the third holds the <tt>cdr</tt> value.  (The
use of a tag should be compared with the similar concept in variant records in
Pascal).

<p>
Data-structures in Scheme are allocated from  the <em>heap</em>,
a large area of  store
devoted to storing most or all data that  is created by the user. Some of  the
heap is in  use, the  rest is  <em>free</em>.
The  boundary between  the two  is at  an
address pointed to by the <em>free-pointer</em>.
To perform the operation <tt>(cons a  b)</tt>,
the store locations following the free  pointer are written into with (1)  the
tag indicating a pair, (2) the value  <tt>a</tt>,
(3) the value <tt>b</tt>. The free-pointer  is
then incremented past the end of the new structure which represents a pair.

<p>
For example, given a pre-existing state of the heap:</p>



<IMG SRC = "heap1.jpg">

<p>
<tt>(cons 3 4)</tt> will be inserted into the heap as:</p>


<IMG SRC = "heap2.jpg">

<p>
[Sorry about the little black rectangle in the figure - it was the text
cursor when I captured the image - I'll redo this at some point - RJP]</p>

<p>
Here, the 3 and 4  stand for the Scheme representation  of 3 and 4, which,  in
UMASS Scheme will in fact be the machine integers 3*4+1 = 13 and 4*4+1 = 17.

<p>
When  the  free-pointer  reaches  the  end  of  the  heap,  a   <em>garbage
collection</em> occurs.  This  is  a system  procedure  which  starts  from
certain locations that it knows the  user program must be able to  access -
the procedure activation records (PAR's) of any currently invoked functions
and the  dictionary of  symbols.  This is  illustrated in  simplified  form
below. Here I have  indicated the boundaries of  individual records in  the
heap by small  vertical lines sticking  up above the  top, while the  areas
marked with dots  above them may  contain many records.  The dictionary  of
symbols is the record  tagged with "D". The  garbage collector starts  from
it, follows  pointers  to  symbol  records  and  from  there  to  <em>value
records</em> which hold the values of global variables. If we have executed
<tt>(define fred (cons 3 4))</tt> then the value record associated with the
symbol 'fred will point to the record for <tt>(cons 3 4)</tt>.</p>



<IMG SRC = "heap3.jpg">


<p>
As the garbage  collector encounters  records in  store it  marks them  with a
one-bit marker, indicated here by a prime(') marker.</p>


<IMG SRC = "heap5.jpg">


<p>
Any unmarked  records  must  be inaccessible  to  the  user. So  they  can  be
reclaimed.</p>


<IMG SRC = "heap6.jpg">


<h2>  Garbage Collection in Computer Languages</h2>

<p>
Garbage collection was invented for the implementation of the LISP language
in the 1950's.  (Let us recall  that Scheme  is a rather  clean dialect  of
LISP) Garbage collection was necessary because of the nature of store usage
in LISP which was intended  to support <em> symbolic computation</em>,  for
example to allow people do algebraic simplification on a computer. When you
are doing symbolic computation  it is difficult to  predict how much  space
the result of evaluating a function is  going to take. For example, if  you
perform a symbolic integration, two integrands that look quite similar</p>


<IMG SRC = "heap7.jpg">

<p>
have  very  different  integrals,  and  consequently  have  different  storage
requirements for representing the result.

<p>
By contrast,  most applications  of  computing in  the 1950's  were  concerned
either with commercial data processing or with numerical computation. For much
numerical computation, sophisticated patterns of store usage do not occur.  It
is trivial to specify how much store you need for the result of the product of
two matrices.  Consequently it  is acceptable  to separate  the allocation  of
space to hold the result of a computation from actually doing the computation.
So you have a style of computation


<pre>
       array C [1,n,1,m];          (* Allocate memory for the result *)
       multiply_matrices(A,B,C);   (* Do the matrix multiplication *)
</pre>

<p>
Commercial computation did work on variable size data-sets. However the major
data sets were held on magnetic tape, and only a small number of  fixed-format
records would  be  in  main memory  at  each  point in  time.  Typically,  the
operations done on these large data-sets were quite simple.

<p>
Consequently it  was left  to the  devisers  of LISP  and its  descendents  to
develop garbage collection technology. But <em>garbage
collection is an  extremely
valuable technology</em>
and  most languages  designed  recently are  intended  to
support garbage collection. Garbage collection is valuable because it prevents
two  kinds   of  errors   being   made  which   can   be  made   if   explicit
allocation/deallocation are in use:
<ul>

<li>
   (1) If a record in memory is not de-allocated when it is in fact not needed
   by the user program, the performance of the user program is degraded below
   the potential of the machine it is running on.

<li>
   (2) If memory is de-allocated when it is in fact in use, then a bug has
   been introduced into the program. Such bugs can be very hard to locate and
   cure.
</ul>


<p>
Garbage collection requires that all pointers existing in the user's program
be identified and used to mark objects.

<p>
Many modern languages  (e.g. ADA,  Modula-3) are designed  to support  garbage
collection, though individual implementations may not do so. Much recent work,
some of  it performed  in UMASS  under Professor  Moss's direction,  has  been
concerned with being able to do garbage collection efficiently.

<p>
It should be noted that the C and  C++ languages do not support most kinds  of
garbage collection,  although experiments  have been  done with  "conservative
collectors". These  work on  the  principle that  "if something  looks  like a
pointer assume  it is  a  pointer". There  is  however a  serious  performance
problem with such collectors.

<p>
The Java language is a C++ derivative which IS garbage collectable.

<p>
A standard garbage collector may relocate cells in memory, making it difficult
to interface  with languages  like C  and Pascal  which do  not  automatically
relocate data once  allocated. Note that  this freedom of  the Scheme  storage
control  mechanism  offers  potential   performance  advantages  for   complex
programs. <em>A
computer can perform tens  of thousands of operations in the  time
it takes to service a  page fault.</em>
Mark Reinholt  has discussed this issue  in
his 1993 MIT PhD Thesis.


<h2>  The "Boxes and Arrows" Representation.</h2>

<p>
Now let us consider how we can the manipulation of list-structures within this
model. We will be  somewhat more abstract  in that we will  no longer draw  an
explicit picture of the heap, but will simply represent the pairs out of which
list structures are made by <em>boxes</em>.


<p>
For the list <tt>'(5
6 7)</tt> this structure is shown below. Recall that the empty  list
is data-type by itself in Scheme. We have shown the <em>value cell</em>
for the Scheme variable <tt>list1</tt> in the diagram as well.</p>


<IMG SRC = "heap8.jpg">

<p>
Note that in many implementations of Scheme,
value cells for local variables are not located in the heap
<em>heap</em> but on the control stack. [Some implementations of Scheme
put Procedure Activation Records in the Heap, and dispense with the need
for a stack - this is actually a more general approach]. </p>



<p>
So, if we have done <tt>(define list2 list1)</tt>, we have a diagram like
this, in which the value cell for the variable <tt>list2</tt> contains a
pointer to the same structure as  that to be found in the value-cell for
<tt> list1</tt>. In this circumstance <tt>(eq? list1 list2) ==> #t </tt>

<IMG SRC = "heap9.jpg">

<p>The effect of using <tt>set-car</tt> to update a component of a
list-structure can be seen below, in which the "S" tag field means
"symbol".


<p>After we do  <tt>(set-car list1 'fred)</tt>.</p>

<IMG SRC = "heap11.jpg">


<p>


<p>
Note that symbols which are <em>equal?</em> are also <em>eq?</em>, but this
is <em> not </em> true for other "compound" data-types like strings and
lists. Scheme standardises symbols by looking each symbol up in a
dictionary as it is read in. So, if we do

<pre>
    (set-car! (cdr list1) 'fred)
</pre>

we get a pointer to the <em>same</em> symbol inserted in the list
<tt>list1</tt></p>.

<IMG SRC = "heap12.jpg">


<p>
This is not true of lists - every time you call <tt>cons</tt>
you make a new cell that is not shared with any pre-existing list.
Consider for example what happens if we do:

<pre><code>
(define list1 (cons 5 '()))
(define list2 (cons 5 '()))
</code></pre>

Each of the two calls of <tt>cons</tt> creates a new pair, the <tt>cdr</tt>
of which points to the unique object which represents the null list.</p>

<IMG SRC = "heap14.jpg">



<p>These
two lists  are <em>not</em> identical, as tested with <tt>eq?</tt>.
But they are structurally equivalent as tested with <tt>equal?</tt>

<pre><code>
(eq? list1 list2)         ==> #f
(equal? list1 list2)      ==> #t
</code></pre>

Now, if we use a mutation operator on <tt>list1</tt> this does not affect
<tt>list2</tt> since the two lists share no component except for the
immutable null object. So if we do:</p>

<pre><code>
(set-car! list1 34)
</code></pre>

<p> we get a structure that looks like this </p>

<IMG SRC = "heap15.jpg">

<pre>
    list1 ==> '(34)
    list2 ==> '(5)
</pre>

<h3> Dotted Pairs and Improper Lists</h3>

<p>
The dotted pair made by <tt>(cons 5 3)</tt> is:</p>




<IMG SRC = "heap16.jpg">

<pre>
        -------------
        |P| 5  | 3  |
        -------------
</pre>
<p>

The improper list  '(5 6 7 . 33) is represented as:</p>


<IMG SRC = "heap17.jpg">



<p>
Partial sharing of structure is also possible. Suppose we do

<pre><code>
    (define list1 '(5 6 7))
    (define list2 (cons 45 (cdr list1)))
</code></pre>

<p>
We will obtain the structure:</p>


<IMG SRC = "heap18.jpg">





<p>
With this structure, if  we do <tt>(set-car! list2  96)</tt>, the value  of
<tt>list1</tt> will not be changed:</p>





<p>but  if we do <tt>(set-car! (cdr  list2
96))</tt>, the value of <tt>list1</tt> <em>will</em> be changed.</p>
