<h2>1  Representing the Predicate Calculus in Scheme</h2></a>

<p> In  the  propositional  calculus  we have  seen  that  we  can  perform
inference using the resolution principle  of "cancelling out" positive  and
negative literals occurring  in the same  clause. In this  lecture we  will
develop the <em>Predicate Calculus</em> and extend the resolution principle
to it by developing the <em>unification algorithm</em> to allow us to  find
out the most general  conditions under which two  literals can be made  the
same.

<p>
In the Predicate Calculus we replace the unstructured propositional  variables
of the propositional calculus by <em>predicates</em>
applied to <em>arguments</em>. A  predicate
can be thought of as expressing a relation between its arguments. For  example
using the standard notation:
<pre>
    loves(John,Mary)
</pre>
<p>
expresses the fact that an individual, <b>John</b>, is enamoured of another
individual, <b>Mary</b>.

<p> As well as  constants such as the  aforementioned lovers, we need  <em>
variables</em> which  are subject  to <em>quantifiers</em>.  The  universal
quantifier, which I shall write  <tt>ForAll</tt> allows us to state  that a
fact is true for  all individuals. Thus  it allows us  to express the  fact
that all humans are mortal as:

<pre>
    ForAll x. human(x) -> mortal(x)
</pre>

<p> The effect of  the universal quantifier is  that we may substitute  any
individual for x in the statement governed by the quantifier. For  example,
we may substitute <tt>Socrates</tt>, obtaining:

<pre>
    human(Socrates) -> mortal(Socrates)
</pre>

<p>
If we also know that <tt>Socrates</tt> is human, that is

<pre>
    human(Socrates)
</pre>

<p>
we may infer, according to the rules of Propositional Logic, that
<tt>Socrates</tt> is mortal:

<pre>
    mortal(Socrates)
</pre>

<p>
Universal quantifiers are not enough of themselves to allow us to express  all
the ideas necessary  for normal logical  discourse. To express  the fact  that
everybody has a  mother, we may  use an <em>
existential  quantifier</em> which I  shall
write <tt>Exists</tt>. Thus we would write:

<pre>
    ForAll p.  Exists m. parent(m,p) & female(m)
</pre>

<p>
The  Predicate  Calculus  as  described  above,  with  predicates,  constants,
variables and quantifiers  is adequate  for logical discourse.  However it  is
convenient to introduce <em>function
symbols</em> as well. For example, one might  have
a function <tt>mother</tt>
for which <tt>mother(p)</tt> is understood to denote the mother of an
individual <tt>p</tt>.

<p>
In fact, for the  formulation of logic  that is normally  used to support  the
Logic Paradigm, we put our logical statements in a conjunctive normal form  in
which all use of the  existential quantifier has been  replaced by the use  of
function symbols, and in which the scope of each universal quantifier is  that
of the clause  in which  it occurs. This  being so,  we are able  to drop  the
explicit presence of universal quantifiers,  the understanding being that  all
variables are implicitly quantified universally.

<p>
We can begin to see how we  might do resolution in the Predicate Calculus.  We
represent the fact that all humans are mortal by


<pre>
     ~ human(x) \/ mortal(x)
</pre>

<p>
and the fact that <tt>Socrates</tt> is human as before by

<pre>
    human(Socrates)
</pre>

Now we cannot immediately use  the propositional principle of resolution,  for
<tt>human(x)</tt>
is  not  the  same  as <tt> human(Socrates)</tt>.
Thus  we  have  to  make a
substitution of <tt>Socrates</tt>
for <tt>x</tt> as we  did before. However, it is obvious  that
this substitution will work;  indeed it is  so obvious that  we will write  an
algorithm to find the best possible substitution for the circumstances, called
the <em>unification algorithm</em>.


<a name = "clauses">
<h2>2  Representing clauses in Scheme.</h2>


<p>
However, it is desirable to  think about how we  can represent clauses in  the
Scheme language so  that we  are not at  a loss  if we want  to implement  our
algorithm.

<p>
The representation of clauses is quite straightforward. We can adopt the usual
rule of Scheme that <tt>or</tt>
is variadic - i.e. takes a variable number of arguments
- and represent a  clause as <tt>(or
l<sub>1</sub>....l<sub>n</sub>)</tt>  where <tt>l<sub>1</sub>...l<sub>n</sub></tt> are  literals. A
literal is  a  predicate  applied  to  arguments,  possibly  negated.  So  the
allowable forms of a literal are:

<pre>
       (p t<sub>1</sub>....t<sub>n</sub>)
       (not (p t<sub>1</sub>....t<sub>n</sub>))
</pre>

<p> And the arguments are <em>terms</em> each of which may be a variable, a
constant or a function-symbol applied to arguments. In the <em>first  order
predicate calculus,</em> function and predicate variables are not allowed.

<h3>2.1  Distinguishing Variables from Constants</h3>


<p>
The range  of possible  constants can  include Scheme  symbols, so  we  have a
problem in  distinguishing  between a  symbol  acting  as a  constant  and  as
variable, just as  we did in  Scheme itself. In  the logic paradigm,  however,
rather than use quotation  to distinguish symbols acting  as constants, it  is
more common to use some  other convention. In the  Lisp community it has  been
common to use a prefixed question mark. In this implementation we will treat a
variable as a list <tt>(? v )</tt> where <tt>v</tt>
is (conventionally) a symbol.

<pre><code>
(define (var? e)
    (and (pair? e) (eq? (car e) '?))
    )
</code></pre>

<p>
This means that any Scheme atom is a <em>constant</em>
in our representation of logic:

<pre><code>
(define constant? atom?)
</code></pre>

<p>
and we may use <tt>equal?</tt> to determine if two constants are the same:

<pre><code>
(define =_constant? equal?)
</code></pre>




<p>So, for example <em>mortal(Socrates)</em> gets encoded as
<pre>
    (or (mortal socrates))
</pre>
<p>while <em>ForAll x. mortal(x)->human(x)</em> gets encoded as

<pre>
    (or (not (mortal (? x))) (human (? x)))
</pre>

<h3>3.1  Binding variables to values; making frames</h3>


<p> To unify two terms <tt>t1</tt> and <tt>t2</tt> we must  <em>determining
a mapping  f  from  variables to  constants  under  which</em>  <tt>f(t1) =
f(t2)</tt>. We will refer to our representation of such a mapping as a <em>
frame</em>. However let us take an  abstract approach, and suppose that  we
have the following operations:

<pre>
make_binding      Makes a "binding" that is a pair associating
                  a variable with a value.

binding-in-frame  Finds a binding for a given variable in a frame

binding-value     Extracts the value component of a binding.

extend            Adds a new variable-value binding to a frame.
</pre>

<p>
We may implement these operations using a-lists for frames as follows:

<pre><code>
(define make-binding cons)

(define binding-in-frame assoc)

(define binding-value cdr)

(define (extend var val frame)
    (cons (make-binding var val) frame))
</code></pre>

<h3>3.2  The function unify</h3>


<p> To unify two  terms <tt>p1</tt> and <tt>p2</tt>  we write the  function
<tt>unify</tt>. It  takes  3 arguments,  <tt>p1,  p2 frame</tt>.  Here  the
<tt>frame</tt> serves the same  role as a frame  in the environment in  our
Scheme interpreter - it remembers what variables have been bound to and  so
avoids having to  perform excessive  substitution. However in  the case  of
unification there  are  extra possibilities  that  have to  be  taken  into
account

<ul>
<li>
    Unification may not be possible. For example if we cannot unify 2 with 3
    To deal with this possibility, we allow the frame to take the value
    <tt>#f</tt>. This should be distinguished from the empty frame
    <tt>'()</tt> which binds no
    variables. For example we may unify 2 with 2, and the resulting frame is
    <tt>'()</tt>. Note that here we are depending on the use of Scheme
    being implemented to the IEEE standard in which the empty list and the
    false truth value are distinct.
<li>
    Variables may be bound to variables. Thus <tt>(? x)</tt>
    unifies with <tt>(? y)</tt> as
    specified in the frame which we can think of as
    <tt>( ((? x) . (? y))).</tt> but which will actually print as
    <tt>( ((? x) ? y)).</tt>
</ul>
<p>
So let  us  consider  the  unification function.  Essentially  there  are  the
following cases to consider

<ul>
<li>
[1] <tt>frame</tt>
may be <tt>#f</tt>.
This case  can arise because the unification has  already
failed but the code has not yet checked that this had happened. Checking  here
simplifies case [5] below. (As well as it being good practice to check for all
types of values an argument can have)

<li> [2] <tt>p1</tt> may  be a variable.  This case turns  out to be  quite
complicated, since <tt>p1</tt> may actually be bound in the  <tt>frame</tt>
and so is not free to be rebound. For example if we try to unify <tt>(+  (?
x) (? x))</tt> with <tt>(+ 2 3)</tt> we will first
 unify the  variable <tt>(?  x)</tt> with  <tt>2</tt> obtaining  the  frame
<tt>(((? x) .  2))</tt>. Then  we will need  to unify  <tt>(? x)</tt>  with
<tt>3</tt>. At this point the unification must fail. So we "pass the  buck"
to an auxiliary function unify_var.


<li> [3] <tt>p2</tt> may be  a variable. Again we call  <tt>unify_var</tt>,
but with its  arguments reversed.  This means  that the  first argument  of
<tt>unify_var</tt> is always guaranteed to  be a variable, simplifying  its
implementation.

<li> [4] If  <tt>p1</tt> is  a constant,  then <tt>p2</tt>  must also  be a
constant, and it must be the <em>same</em> constant.

<li> [5] If <tt>p2</tt> is a constant then <tt>p1</tt> could not have  been
a constant, so unification fails.

<li> [6] Otherwise  both <tt>p1</tt>  and <tt>p2</tt> must  be lists  which
represent complex  terms  and  not variables.  So  we  call  <tt>unify</tt>
recursively on the <tt>car</tt> and  <tt>cdr</tt> of both. However we  have
to treat <tt>frame</tt> as a kind of  accumulator, in much the same way  as
we needed an  accumulator when  we were  making a  list of  the nodes  of a
ordered tree. So we  call <tt>unify</tt> on the  <tt>car</tt>'s of the  two
terms [6.2]  obtaining a  new frame  which embodies  any variable  bindings
necessary to  unify the  <tt>cdr</tt>'s, and  then we  pass this  frame  to
another  call  of  <tt>unify</tt>  [6.1]   which  proceeds  to  unify   the
<tt>cdr</tt>'s, keeping the unification  consistent with the bindings  made
in the <tt>car</tt>'s. </ul>

<pre><code>
(define (unify p1 p2 frame)
    (cond
        ((eq? frame #f) #f)                             ;[1]
        ((var? p1) (unify_var p1 p2 frame))             ;[2]
        ((var? p2) (unify_var p2 p1 frame))             ;[3]
        ((constant? p1)                                 ;[4]
         (if (constant? p2)
             (if (=_constant? p1 p2) frame #f)
             #f))
        ((constant? p2) #f)                             ;[5]
        (else                                           ;[6]
            (unify (cdr p1)                             ;[6.1]
                (cdr p2)
                (unify                                  ;[6.2]
                    (car p1)
                    (car p2)
                    frame)))))
</code></pre>

<h3>3.3  The unify_var function unifies a variable with a term</h3>

<p> Now
we  come  to  the definition  of  <tt>unify_var</tt>.  There  is a
subtlety here that needs to be dealt with. What happens if we try to  unify
a variable with a term that <em>already contains the variable</em>. Suppose
we want  to  unify  a variable  <tt>(?  x)</tt>  with the  term  <tt>(f  (?
x))</tt>; we can  only do this  if we systematically  replace the  variable
<tt>(? x)</tt> with <tt>(f (?  x))</tt> everywhere in our terms,  including
<em>inside</em> the term <tt>(f (? x))</tt>. But this involves an  infinite
amount of work generating an infinite  term. This kind of thing can  happen
if we try to unify:

<pre>
    (g (? x) (f (? x)))
    (g (? y) (? y))
</pre>

<p> Standard logic does not allow  such a circular substitution to  happen,
and so  we have  to put  an <em>occurs  check</em> into  <tt>unify_var</tt>
which makes sure that we  do not unify a variable  with a term in which  it
occurs. [It should be noted that the best known computer language based  on
the Logic Paradigm, Prolog, does not perform the occurs check because it is
computationally expensive].

<p> So let us  now consider the  definition of <tt>unify_var</tt>.  Firstly
[1] we have to  allow for the possiblity  that <tt>val</tt> is a  variable,
and indeed is the same variable as <tt>var</tt>. In this case,  unification
is trivial with the existing <tt>frame</tt> [1.1].

<p> Otherwise we find the value-cell for  the value of the variable in  the
<tt>frame</tt> [2].

<p> If  [3]  it  does not  exist,  then  we may  bind  <tt>var</tt>  to  be
<tt>val</tt> in a new frame made by <tt>extend</tt> [3.2]. However this  is
only legal if the "occurs-check" implemented by <tt>freefor?</tt>  succeeds
[3.1] - otherwise unification fails [3.3].

<p>
If [4] the variable <tt>var</tt> <em>was</em>
bound in  the <tt>frame</tt>, then we call <tt>unify</tt> to see  if
the value of <tt>var</tt> in <tt>frame</tt> and <tt>val</tt> can be unified.


<pre><code>
(define (unify_var var val frame)
    (if (equal? var val)                                    ;[1]
        frame                                               ;[1.1]
        (let ((value-cell (binding-in-frame var frame)))    ;[2]
            (if (not value-cell)                            ;[3]
                (if (freefor? var val frame)                ;[3.1]
                    (extend var val frame)                  ;[3.2]
                    #f)                                     ;[3.3]
                (unify (binding-value value-cell)           ;[4]
                    val
                    frame)))))
</code></pre>

<h3>3.4  Implementing the occurs check with freefor?</h3>


<p>
Finally let us  look at  <tt>freefor?</tt>.
We write  this with  an internal  recursive
function <tt>freewalk</tt>
to save  us the trouble of  passing more than one  argument.
So, we are  asking, is  <tt>exp</tt>
free  of occurrences  of <tt>var</tt>?  We recurse  through
<tt>freewalk</tt>,
examining the various possible types of the expression <tt>e</tt>.

<ul>

<li> [1] If <tt>e</tt> is a  constant, then <tt>var</tt> does not occur  in
it!

<li> [2]  If  <tt>e</tt>  is  a  variable, and  is  the  same  variable  as
<tt>var</tt> then
         [2.1]  <tt>var</tt>  does  occur  in  <tt>e</tt>,  so  we   return
<tt>#f</tt>. Othewise, we  look up <tt>e</tt>  in <tt>frame</tt> [2.2].  If
<tt>e</tt> is  not bound,  then  we conclude  that  <tt>e</tt> is  free  of
<tt>var</tt>, so we return <tt>#t</tt> [2.3]. If it is bound, then we  look
to see if <tt>var</tt>  occurs in the value  to which <tt>e</tt> was  bound
[2.4].

<li> [3] Otherwise <tt>e</tt> must be a complex term, so we look to see  if
the <tt>car</tt>  of <tt>e</tt>  is free  of <tt>var</tt>.  If it  is,  the
<tt>cdr</tt> of <tt>e</tt> must also be free of <tt>e</tt>.

<li> [4]  Finally, if <tt>(car e)</tt>
was not free of <tt>var</tt> then <tt>e</tt> itself
is not free of <tt>var</tt>.
</ul>

<pre><code>
(define (freefor? var exp frame)
    (letrec
        (
         (freewalk
             (lambda (e)
                 (cond
                     ((constant? e) #t)                            ;[1]
                     ((var? e)                                     ;[2]
                      (if (equal? var e) #f                        ;[2.1]
                          (let ((b (binding-in-frame e frame)))    ;[2.2]
                              (if (not b) #t                       ;[2.3]
                                  (freewalk (binding-value b)))))) ;[2.4]
                     ( (freewalk (car e)) (freewalk (cdr e)))      ;[3]
                     (else #f))                                    ;[4]
                 )  ;end lambda
             ) ; end freewalk binding
         ) ;end letrec bindings
        (freewalk exp)
        ) ;end letrec
    )
