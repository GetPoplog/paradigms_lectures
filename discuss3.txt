A permutation on a set S is a finite one-to-one mapping from the finite
set S onto itself. Permutations are commonly represented by  mathematicians
as a set of  cycles. For example,  (1 2 3)  is a cycle,  meaning that 1  is
mapped to 2, and 2 is mapped to 3 and 3 is mapped to 1. A permutation  that
is not  a single  cycle on  the whole  set S  is written  as using  several
cycles.

So a permutation  {(1 2 3),(4 5)} would be the map f, say, from the set
{1,2,3,4,5} to itself for which

    f(1) = 2
    f(2) = 3
    f(3) = 1
    f(4) = 5
    f(5) = 4

In Scheme, we could represent a cycle by a list, and a permutation by
a list of cycles.  So the above permutation would be represented by

    '((1 2 3)(4 5))


Another way that you can represent any finite map in Scheme is as an
association list This is a list of argument-value pairs. For example our
permutation could be written as:

    '((1 2) (2 3) (3 1) (4 5) (5 4))

You are to:

(a) Write a Scheme function alist_of_cycles to take a permutation expressed
as a list of cycles and transform it into the equivalent association list
form.

(b) Write a Scheme function cycles_of_alist to take a permutation expressed
as an association list and convert  it into a list of cycles.
