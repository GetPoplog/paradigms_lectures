These problems are to be done in groups.

Each group should prepare answers to all 3 problems. At 10:40 each
group will give its answer to a "grading group", and will receive
an answer from another group. The answer should be graded out
of 10.  At 10:50 the graded papers will be given back.






(1) Write a Scheme function "product" to multiply the members of a list.

(product '(3 4 5)) ==> 60

[3 marks]

(2) Write a Scheme function  "last" to find the last member of a list.

(last '(4 5 6))          ==> 6

(last '(11 23 44 55))    ==> 55

[3 marks]

(3) Write a Scheme function  "alternate" which takes a list as argument
and returns a new list which contains every alternate member of the first
list.

(alternate '(4 5 6 7 8))  ==> (4 6 8)

(alternate '(11 22 33 44))  ==> (11 33)

[4 marks]
