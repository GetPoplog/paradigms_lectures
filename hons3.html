<H1>Conditionals Recursion Lists</H1>

<H2>Special forms in SML</H2>

<P>Special forms in SML include</P>

<P>(1) Functions<TT> fn x =&gt; x+5 </TT>is the equivalent of (lambda (x)
(+ x 5))</P>

<P>(2) Definitions</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>val x = 34+7;</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>is the equivalent of<TT> (define x (+ 34 7))</TT></P>

<P>You can define non-recursive functions this way</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>val double= fn x =&gt; x*2</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>But you can't use this to define recursive functions, for which you
must use the fun or letrec constructs introduced later.</P>

<P>(3) Tuples. A list of (at least two) expressions separated by commas
and enclosed in parentheses</P>

<UL>
<P>(expr<SUB>1</SUB>,expr<SUB>2</SUB>,...expr<SUB>n</SUB>)</P>
</UL>

<P>is called a tuple. A 2-tuple is called a pair. </P>

<P>Note that various syntactic variants such as x+y are not special forms.
In SML x+y means &quot;apply the function + to the pair (x,y).</P>

<P>The <TT>if ...then...else</TT> construction in SML</P>

<P>SML&nbsp;provides conditional expressions in which a condition (an expression
which must have a boolean value) or conditions are used to choose which
of a number of other expressions is to be evaluated. The simplest form
of conditional in SML is the special form: </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>if <B>condition</B> then <B>expr1</B> else <B>expr2</B></TT></P>
</UL>

<P>It evaluates <B>condition.</B> If the condition evaluates to true
then expr1 is evaluated and is the value of the whole conditional expression,
otherwise expr2 is evaluated and is the value of the whole conditional
expression.</P>

<P>Note that SML&nbsp;differs from Scheme in that <B>condition</B> must
be a boolean expression.</P>

<P>A list in SML&nbsp;is written in square brackets. All the objects in
the list must be of the same type.</P>

<P>[1,2,3]</P>

<P>fun average list = sum(list) / length(list);</P>
