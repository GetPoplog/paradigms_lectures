<H1>Implementing Constructive Proof Rules for SML in MetaSML</h1>

This report describes the use of the MetaSML extension of the  SML core
language as an implementation medium for a system for the verification of a
purely-functional subset of SML programs.


<p>This system has a strong,  and non-accidental resemblance to the  system
for mechanising proofs  in Higher Order  Logic, HOL. But  whereas HOL  is a
system for proving mathematical theorems, whose domain of interpretation is
a universe  of  infinite  sets,  and, which,  in  particular,  treats  each
lambda-expression as  denoting a  mathematical function,  our system  deals
with the  result of  evaluating  expressions in  SML <em>restricted  to  the
functional subset of ML</em>.

<p>As compared  with  the work  of  Boyer  and Moore,  we  are  providing a
proof-checker, not a  proof-finder. However,  we would  anticipate that  it
would  be  possible  to  incorporate  HOL-style  conversions,  tactics  and
tacticals to ease the process of generating proofs.

<p>As a consequence of our domain being SML, our proof rules are weaker
than those of HOL. For example, HOL contains a proof rule that allows the
user unconditionally to create the theorem <tt> |- <em>t = t</em></tt>
for any well-typed term <em>t</em>.  Our system puts the interpretation on
<em>t=t</em> that, as a conclusion of a  theorem,
it is a type-correct SML expression that will run to completion  yielding
the result <tt>true</tt> under conditions determined by the hypotheses of the
theorem in which it occurs.
There are two restrictions inherent in this requirement. Firstly
if <em>t</em> is a function, then <em>t = t</em> is not well-typed, and
so is not a valid inference. Secondly the code must run to completion,
so that <em>t=t</em> is only valid if <em>t</em> engenders a computation
that terminates normally for all type-correct values of its free variables.

<p>So, for example, if <tt>fact</tt> is the factorial function as usually
defined,  <tt> fact = fact </tt> is not well-typed, and so <tt> |-
fact=fact</tt> is not admissable as a theorem of our system;
neither is
<tt>fact n = fact n</tt>  unconditionally valid in our system,
for it is not the case that the evaluation of <tt> fact n </tt> will
terminate normally for a negative integer argument.
In fact, the appropriate theorem
is  <tt> 0<=n |- fact n = fact n </tt>

<h2> MetaSML </h2>

<p>The prover is implemented in MetaSML [Sheard...] which is derived from SML
by providing a quasi-quotation mechanism. If  <em>e</em> is an SML
expression of type <em>t</em>, then  <em>&lt;e></em> is a MetaSML expression
of type <em>&lt;t></em>. Thus the angle brackets <tt>&lt...></tt> act to
support a form of quotation, which resembles quasi-quotation in Scheme in
that there is a local escape mechanism, using the tilde operator.


<p>Note
that MetaSML's handling of variables that are  free in an expression
but bound in the environment in which the expression was created avoids
a variable capture problem arising from a sequence like the following:

<pre>
fun twice x = 2*x;

(*
code to create a theorem about twice
*)

fun twice f = f(f x)

(*
code which uses the earlier theorems about twice in the context
of the new definition.
*)

</pre>

We need to say something about e.g. the status of + in <3 + 4>  I've
used the term "name" - the "+" is the name of the addition function.

<h2>Theorems say things about the result of computation</h2>

In our system we adopt the basic  idea of HOL, which was due originally  to
Robin Milner, that a theorem is an abstract data-type of MetaSML whose only
constructors are proof-rules; if these rules are sound, it is only possible
for the user to construct theorems. So the validity of the theorems
depends constructed by the user depends only on whether or not the
proof-rules correctly capture the semantics of SML.

<p>Given this repetoire of proof-rules, and given that a user has the
ability to discover (but not change) the fine structure of theorems by
using selector functions and patterns of MetaSML, it is possible to build
systems which can partially automate the process of proof.


<p> The logically significant components of the <em>theorem</em>
data-type are a list of <em>hypotheses</em> and a <em>conclusion</em>.
The data-type <tt>theorem</tt> might thus concretely be declared as

<pre>
datatype theorem = Thm of &lt;bool> list * &lt;bool> list;
</pre>

Thus each hypothesis is a MetaSML term of type <tt>&lt;bool></tt>, that is  to
say it is a quoted SML expression, which when evaluated, will yield a
truth-value. Likewise a conclusion is also a MetaSML list term of type
<tt>&lt;bool></tt>.


<h4> Notation for theorems </h4>

If  H is a set of hypotheses, represented as a list (without repetitions) then
we use the notation
<pre>
            H |- t
</pre>
for the theorem  <tt>Theorem(G,t)</tt>. When writing theorems we will drop
the angle-brackets around the hypotheses and conclusions. Incidentally, the
hypotheses of a theorem are conceptually a sequence, rather than a set. Certain
proof rules operate on the first hypothesis of that sequence.

<h4>Consonantly typed environments</h4>

<p>By a consonantly-typed  environment for  an expression is  meant a  mapping
from variables  to values  whose domain  includes the  free variables  of  the
expression and in which the  image of each variable  under the map belongs  to
the type ascribed to that variable by the SML type inference system.


<p>
Our proof rules will be sound if they can only generate theorems that satisfy
the following data-invariant

<h4> The Theorem Invariant</h4>
For every
consonantly-typed environment in for which each hypothesis of the theorem
evaluates to <tt>true</tt>,   the conclusion  will also evaluate  to
<tt>true</tt>.



<p>We use the notation <tt> t<sub>1</sub> ==> t<sub>2</sub> </tt> as an abbreviation for
<tt>&#160;  if t<sub>1</sub> then t<sub>2</sub> else true</tt>, so that <tt>t<sub>2</sub></tt> is only
evaluated if <tt>t<sub>1</sub></tt> evaluates to <tt>true</tt>.
Thus <tt> ==> </tt> is <em>not</em> defined  as
an infix operator  in ML,  since that  would imply  a different  evaluation
rule.

<h2> Proof Rules are abstract constructors for theorems</h2>

The actual concrete constructor <tt>Theorem</tt> for theorems is not
available to the user of the system. Instead she must employ proof rules.
These are MetaSML functions which evaluate to a theorem, or occasionally,
to a list of theorems.

<p>We adopt the HOL convention of capitalising the names of the
MetaSML functions which implement proof rules.


<p>For exposition it is convenient to adopt the usual notation for proof
rules

<pre>
     thm<sub>1</sub>,  thm<sub>2</sub> ... thm<sub>n</sub>
    ______________________

       thm
</pre>

which expresses the fact that <tt>thm</tt> is a sound deduction from
<tt>thm<sub>1</sub>,thm<sub>2</sub>...thm<sub>n</sub></tt>. This captures
the basic pattern of deduction, which may be qualified by additional
conditions expressed in the text. Further explanation is needed as
to how the corresponding MetaSML function is used.

<p>It is a consequence of our concept of soundness that we need more proof
rules than HOL. This arises from the fact that the DISCH rule in HOL

<pre>
        g, H |- t
    ______________

        H |- g ==> t
</pre>

is not sound in our system, for <tt>g</tt> might not halt unconditionally.
HOL makes great use of this rule to move terms from the hypotheses to the
conclusion, wherein they are transformed and then moved back by the
<tt>UNDISCH</tt> rule. We, by contrast, need rules that will allow us to
operate directly on the hypotheses of a theorem.


<p>In addition to the proof-rules
there is a set of <em>axioms</em> which are pre-created
theorems expressing basic facts about SML, for example that addition over
the <tt>int</tt> type is commutative.



<h2> Halting </h2>

The concept of <em>halting</em> is central to our system. We define
the SML function

<pre>
    fun halts t = true;
</pre>

Clearly, if we have a  theorem  <tt> |- halts <b>e</b></tt>, for some
expression <b>e</b>, then under the interpretation rules given above,
the eager evaluation of the  expression <b>e</b> must always terminate
without exception. [In a lazy language, this would not be the case.]

<p>However, this treatment means that we may <em>not</em> apply the usual
rules of instantiation. For example, while for any variable <tt>x</tt>
there is a  theorem    <tt> |- halts x </tt>,  it is not permissable
to substitute an arbitrary expression for <tt>x</tt>. Otherwise, for
example, we could "prove" <pre> |- halts(fact n) </pre>  Thus, in
particular, many of our proof-rules will require extra termination
conditions as compared with HOL.

<p>The following basic rules are sound for <tt>halts</tt>:

<h4>HALTS_EVAL : term -> theorem </h4>

<pre>
     _____________

      |-  halts t
</pre>

provided that  <tt>t</tt> is a term with no free variables which evaluates
without exception.

<p><b>Justification</b>
Having no free variables, <tt>t</tt> evaluates without exception in every
consonantly typed environment. From the definition of <tt>halts</tt>,
<tt>halts t</tt> evaluates to <tt>true</tt>. Hence <tt> halts t</tt>
is universally valid, and so the rule is sound.



<p>For example

<pre>
    HALTS_EVAL <2+3>  =  |- halts 2+3
</pre>

<h4>HALTS_VAR : term -> theorem </h4>

<pre>
     _______________

        |- halts v
</pre>

provided that  <tt>v</tt> is a variable.

<p><b>Justification</b>
Any environment whose domain includes <tt>v</tt> is consonantly typed, and
is an environment in which the evaluation of <tt>v</tt> terminates without
exception.  From the definition of <tt>halts</tt>,
<tt>halts t</tt> evaluates to <tt>true</tt>. Hence <tt>halts t</tt>
is universally valid and so the rule is sound.



<h2> Paths, Patterns  Substitution and Matching</h2>


<p>We use  <tt>  t<sub>1</sub>[x:=t<sub>2</sub>]  </tt>  to  denote  the  term
<tt>t<sub>1</sub></tt> with every free  occurrence of the variable  <tt>x</tt>
replaced by <tt>t<sub>2</sub></tt>, with suitable alpha-renaming to avoid free
variable capture.

Likewise, we use
<pre>
 t[x<sub>1</sub>..x<sub>n</sub> := a<sub>1</sub>..a<sub>n</sub>]
</pre>

to denote the term  <tt>t<sub>1</sub></tt> with every  free occurrence of  the
variables  <tt>x<sub>i</sub></tt>  replaced  by  <tt>a<sub>i</sub></tt>,  with
suitable alpha-renaming to avoid free variable capture.

<p>We use the concept of a path to identify a particular sub-expression of
an expression.
<pre>
type path = int list
</pre>

<p>  We write  <tt>t[p]</tt> to mean the sub-term of <tt>t</tt>
addressed by the path <tt>p</tt>.

We write  <tt>t[p:=t']</tt> to mean the result of replacing the
sub-term of <tt>t</tt> addressed by the path <tt>p</tt> by <tt>t'</tt>.



<h4>Matching a Pattern against an Expression</h4>

<p>We write <tt>p[x<sub>1</sub>..x<sub>n</sub>]</tt> to denote a pattern whose free variables are <tt>x<sub>1</sub>..x<sub>n</sub></tt>.

<p>Deduction
in of our system could be treated by eliminating patterns from the
discourse, translating everything into he lambda calculus. While this approach
has the virtue of simplicity, it is achieved at the cost of moving the
discourse significantly away form the source language, making it
harder for the user to follow what is happening, and also making
proofs longer.


<p>There
are  three possible  cases which  arise if  we try  to match  a  pattern
<tt>p</tt> against an expression <tt>t</tt>.


<ul>

<li> There can never be a match
<li> There is always a match
<li> There is sometimes a match.

</ul>

For example  the pattern <tt>[]</tt> can never match the expression
<tt>x::l</tt>, whereas the pattern <tt>0</tt> can sometimes match the
expression <tt>n</tt> (when <tt>n</tt> evaluates to <tt>0</tt>).

<b> TIM HELP! </b>

<p>The idea of a match can then be expressed as


<pre>
datatype match = Match of (&lt; var > * &lt; val > list) * &lt;bool> list
</pre>


Our approach is thus to define a function
<pre>
match : <pattern> -> <term> -> match option
</pre>


<pre>
fun BETA (x as &lt;(fn #p => ~(f #p) | ~y) ~a>) =
       (case match p a of
          SOME sub => Thm([<halts ~a>], < ~x = ~(f a) >)
        | NONE => BETA <~y ~a>)
  | BETA _ = error

p : ('a,X) pattern
f : X substitution -> <'b>
match : ('a,'b) pattern -> <'a> -> 'b substitution
y : <'a -> 'b>
</pre>



<h2> Using Definitions in Proofs </h2>

It is  a great convenience to allow definitions, made in the core-SML
subset of MetaSML, to be used in proofs.

<p>This requires some care, since it is a consequence of our concept of
<em>validity</em> that a definition such as

<pre>
    fun double x = x*2;
</pre>

cannot in general be made into the theorem

<pre>
    |- double x = x*2
</pre>

since in general a function won't terminate. Instead, we introduce
rules that allow a definition to be used directly in a proof.
For the purposes of explication of the definitional rules, we
write a definition
<pre>
val v = t
</pre>

as

<pre>
  |-<sub>DEF</sub>  v = t
</pre>

Since MetaSML keeps a firm hold on the scope of definitions, the following
definitional-substitution rule preserves validity.

<p>No problem is raised by recursive definitions. For example

<pre>
    fact 0 = 1 | fact n = n*fact(n-1)
</pre>

is converted into the definition

<pre>
    |-<sub>DEF</sub> fact = fn 0 => 1 | n => n*fact(n-1)
</pre>

Here the occurrence of <tt>fact</tt> in the <pre>fn...</pre> expression
is not a free variable but is instead the name of the factorial function.

<h4>DEF_RIGHT: path -> theorem -> theorem </h4>

DEF_RIGHT allows us to use a definition to replace a defined-name
occurring in the conclusion of a theorem by its value.

<pre>
        |-<sub>DEF</sub>  v = t ,  H |- t<sub>1</sub>
   ___________________________________

            H |-  t<sub>1</sub>[p:=t]

 </pre> provided <tt>t<sub>1</sub>[p] = v</tt>

<p>As a MetaSML function,
we provide <tt>DEF_RIGHT</tt> with a path to the occurrence of a
name that is to be replaced by its definition, and a theorem in whose
conclusion the replacement is to be done.

<h4>Justification</h4>
This rule expresses the fact that in evaluating an expression <tt>t<sub>1</sub>
</tt> containing <tt>v</tt>, the value <tt>t</tt> of <tt>v</tt> will be
used. Therefore   <tt>t<sub>1</sub></tt> and <tt>t<sub>1</sub>[p:=t]</tt>
will evaluate to equal values.

<p>In effect, DEF is unfolding the definition of <tt>v</tt>.


<h4>DEF_LEFT : path -> theorem -> theorem </h4>

<pre>
        |-<sub>DEF</sub>  v = t ,  g,G |- t<sub>1</sub>
   ___________________________________

        g[p:=t], H |- t<sub>1</sub>
</pre>

provided <tt>g[p] = v</tt>.


<p>As a MetaSML function
we provide DEF_LEFT with a path to the occurrence of a
name that is to be replaced by its definition, and a theorem in whose
first hypothesis the replacement is to be done.


<h4>Justification</h4>
Essentially the same as for the previous rule.


<h2> The Main Inference Rules </h2>

These inference rules differ quite a lot from those of HOL, mostly because
of the requirement that the conclusion of a valid theorem must represent a
computation that terminates normally when the hypotheses all evaluate to
<tt>true</tt>.  The general effect of this is to require more rules.

<p>In particular, we lose the reflexive rule of equality ( <tt> |- t = t
</tt>). Instead, this has to be proved in every case. It is (perhaps
conditionally) true for combinations of the language primitives, but must
be proved for user-defined functions.

<p>Moreover, the classical <em>reductio ad absurdam</em> rule
does not hold. From
<pre>
                not t |- false
</pre>
we cannot conclude  <tt> |- t </tt>. The first theorem says
"whenever <tt>t</tt> terminates normally, it must evaluate to <tt>true</tt>",
whereas the second says "<tt>t</tt> always evaluates to <tt>true</tt>".


<p>Thus we are much more constrained in moving terms
from the hypotheses to the conclusions of theorems than we are in HOL. As a
consequence, our proof-rules require us to operate on hypotheses as well as
conclusions.

<p>The following are our basic rules.

<hr><h4>PROMOTE : int -> theorem -> theorem;</h3>

PROMOTE serves to select a hypothesis to be operated on by a proof rule.

<pre>
g<sub>0</sub>...g<sub>i</sub>...g<sub>n</sub> |- t
__________________________

g<sub>i</sub>,g<sub>0</sub>...g<sub>i-1</sub> g<sub>i+1</sub>...g<sub>n</sub> |- t
</pre>



<b>Justification</b>
Clearly changing the order of the hypotheses of a theorem does not violate
its data-invariant.


<hr><h4>ASSUME : term -> theorem;</h3>
<pre>

           ________

            t |- t

</pre>

<b>Justification</b>
In any environment in which the hypothesis evaluates to <tt>true</tt>, the
conclusion also evaluates to <tt>true</tt>

<p>The soundness of this rule depends upon the fact
that our terms are restricted to the functional subset of SML, in which the
value of an expression is determined solely by the constant objects
(including function closures) embodied in it and by the values that its
free variables have in the environment in which it is evaluated.




<hr><h4>SUBST : path -> term -> thm -> thm </h4>


<pre>
        H<sub>1</sub>  |- t<sub>1</sub> = t<sub>1</sub>'          H |- t
        _________________________________________

             H<sub>1</sub> union H |- t[p:=t<sub>1</sub>']
</pre>

provided the structural identity t[p] = t<sub>1</sub> holds.

<p><b>Justification</b>
<p>
The first theorem expresses the fact in any environment in which  each
expression  in  H<sub>1</sub>  evaluates  to  <tt>true</tt>,  then  t<sub>1</sub>  and
t<sub>1</sub>' evaluate to equal values in the same environment. The second
theorem expresses the fact that in any environment in which each expression
in  H  evaluates  to  <tt>true</tt>,  <em>t</em>  also  evaluates   to
<tt>true</tt>.

The rule states that in any environment in which all the hypotheses in H<sub>1</sub> and
H evaluate  to <tt>true</tt>,  the term  <em>t</em> with  an occurrence  of
<em>t<sub>1</sub></em>  replaced  by   <em>t<sub>1</sub>'</em>  will   also
evaluate to <tt>true</tt>


<p>This rule expresses the fact that objects which SML judges to be equal
are indistinguishable by any SML program. It would not apply to a language
such as Scheme, where it is possible to distinguish between objects that
are structurally equivalent (using <tt>equal?</tt>) and those which are
identical (using <tt>eq?</tt>).



<hr><h4>SUBST_LEFT : path -> term -> thm -> thm </h4>

In the light of our discussion about the need for rules that operate
on hypotheses, we also need the following:


<pre>
        H<sub>1</sub>  |- t<sub>1</sub> = t<sub>1</sub>'          t<sub>2</sub>,G |- t<sub>3</sub>
        _________________________________________

           t<sub>2</sub>[p:=t<sub>1</sub>],  H<sub>1</sub> union H |- t<sub>3</sub>
</pre>

provided t<sub>2</sub>[p] = t<sub>1</sub>.


<p><b>Justification</b>

Similar to that for SUBST.


<hr><h4>RESOLVE : theorem -> theorem -> theorem </h4>

<pre>
    H |- t      H' |- t'
___________________________

     (H - t') union H' |- t

</pre>

<p><b>Justification</b>
Suppose all the terms of
<pre>
     (H - t') union H'
</pre>

evaluate to <tt>true</tt>. Then <tt>t'</tt> evaluates to true, by the
second input theorem. Therefore all the terms of <tt>H</tt> evaluate to
<tt>true</tt>. Thus <tt>t</tt> evaluates to <tt>true</tt>.



<hr><h4>DISCH : term -> theorem ->theorem -> theorem </h4>

Discharging an assumption proves to be more complex than it does in HOL,
because we have to allow for the possibility of a computation not
terminating.


<pre>
            H |- t<sub>2</sub>
_________________________________________

   halts t<sub>1</sub>,  (H - {t<sub>1</sub>}) |-  t<sub>1</sub> ==> t<sub>2</sub>

</pre>



<p><b>Justification</b>

The theorem <tt>G |- t<sub>2</sub> </tt>
requires that in any environment in which all the expressions
of H evaluate to <tt>true</tt>, then <em>t<sub>2</sub></em> also evaluates
to <tt>true</tt>.

<p>Now suppose we have an environment in which all the expressions of

<pre>
   halts t<sub>1</sub> ( H - {t<sub>1</sub>} )
</pre>
evaluate to <tt>true</tt>. In these circumstances we know that
t<sub>1</sub>  halts. There are thus two cases to consider:

<ul>
<li> t<sub>1</sub> evaluates to <tt>true</tt>: hence all
the  hypotheses
in H also evaluate to <tt>true</tt>. Hence t<sub>2</sub> also evaluates  to
<tt>true</tt>,   and   therefore   <tt>not</tt>   t<sub>1</sub>
<tt>==></tt> t<sub>2</sub> evaluates to <tt>true</tt>.

<p><li> t<sub>1</sub> evaluates to <tt>false</tt>: <tt>not
t<sub>1</sub> </tt> evaluates to <tt>true</tt>, and hence by the
short-circuit rule for the evaluation of <tt>==></tt>,  t<sub>1</sub>
==> t<sub>2</sub> evaluates to <tt>true</tt>.

</ul>

<hr><h4> MP : theorem -> theorem -> theorem </h4>

MP implements the modus ponens rule of logic.

<pre>

    H<sub>1</sub> |- t<sub>1</sub> ==> t<sub>2</sub>,    H<sub>2</sub> |- t<sub>1</sub>
    __________________________________

        H<sub>1</sub> union H<sub>2</sub>  |-  t<sub>2</sub>
</pre>


<p><b>Justification</b>
<p>In an environment in which all the expressions of H<sub>1</sub> union H<sub>2</sub> evaluate
to <tt>true</tt>, t<sub>1</sub> will  evaluate to <tt>true</tt>. In such an
environment,
<pre>
    t<sub>1</sub> ==> t<sub>2</sub>
</pre>
has the same value as  t<sub>2</sub>. But, since all  the hypotheses in H<sub>1</sub>  also
evaluate  to  <tt>true</tt>,  it   follows  that
<tt> t<sub>1</sub> ==> t<sub>2</sub> </tt> also evaluates to <tt>true</tt>, so
t<sub>2</sub>
evaluates to <tt>true</tt>.

<hr><h4>BETA : term -> thm;</h4>
Our equivalent of the BETA rule of HOL is complicated by our supporting patterns.


<pre>

  ____________________________________________________________

    halts t<sub>2</sub> |-  (fn p[x<sub>1</sub>..x<sub>n</sub>] => t<sub>1</sub>|f) t<sub>2</sub> = t<sub>1</sub>[x<sub>1</sub>..x<sub>n</sub> := a<sub>1</sub>..a<sub>n</sub>]

</pre>
provided
<pre>
    match p t<sub>2</sub> = SOME(Match([(x<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>1</sub>)..(x<sub>n</sub>,a<sub>n</sub>)],[]))
</pre>
(that is the match is unconditionally successful)

<pre>

  ____________________________________________________________

    halts t<sub>2</sub> |-  (fn p[x<sub>1</sub>..x<sub>n</sub>] => t<sub>1</sub>|f) t<sub>2</sub> = f t<sub>2</sub>
</pre>

provided
<pre>
    match p t<sub>2</sub> = NONE
</pre>
(that is the match is unsuccessful)


<pre>

  ____________________________________________________________

    halts t<sub>2</sub>, e<sub>1</sub>...e<sub>m</sub> |-  (fn p[x<sub>1</sub>..x<sub>n</sub>] => t<sub>1</sub>|f) t<sub>2</sub> = t<sub>1</sub>[x<sub>1</sub>..x<sub>n</sub> := a<sub>1</sub>..a<sub>n</sub>],
    halts t<sub>2</sub>, not(e<sub>1</sub>)...not(e<sub>m</sub>) |-  (fn p[x<sub>1</sub>..x<sub>n</sub>] => t<sub>1</sub>|f) t<sub>2</sub> = f t<sub>2</sub>


</pre>

when
<pre>
    match p t<sub>2</sub> = SOME(Match([(x<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>1</sub>)..(x<sub>n</sub>,a<sub>n</sub>)],[ e<sub>1</sub>...e<sub>m</sub>]))
</pre>



<hr><h4>INSTANTIATE variable -> expression -> theorem -> theorem</h4>

<pre>
                H |- t
        ___________________________

        halts e, H[v:=e] |- t[v:=e]
</pre>

INSTANTIATE allows us to replace a free variable in a theorem by
an expression. However we have to add the additional hypothesis that
the evaluation of the expression halts.

<p><b>Justification:</b>
<p>The input theorem says that for
any type-correct mapping from its free variables to values under which all
expressions of H evaluate to <tt>true</tt>, the expression <tt>t</tt> also
evaluates to <tt>true</tt>.  Now suppose we have an environment rho under
which
the expression <tt>e</tt> terminates normally, so that <tt>eval rho e</tt>
is defined and
<pre>
eval rho g[v:=e] = true
</pre>
Then
<pre>
eval rho g[v:=e] = eval rho[v:=eval e rho] g = true
</pre>  for g in G.
Hence
<pre>
eval rho t[v:=e] = eval rho[v:=eval e rho] t = true
</pre>



<h2> Axioms </h2>

We regard axioms as being pre-defined theorems which express facts about an
implementation of SML idealised in the sense that it implements the integers.
Note that the axioms of our system are not minimal: rather than taking a
reductionist stance, we regard our axioms as a convenient way of
characterising how an idealised version of SML behaves.

<p>We will use axioms subject to the instantiate rule, which, as you will
recall, introduces a halting requirement when an expression is substituted
for a variable.


<h3> The axioms for the members of the type <tt>int</tt></h3>



<h4> The members of the type <tt>int</tt> form a commutative ring with
identity</h4>

<p> members of <tt>int</tt> form an abelian group
<pre>
I1      |-  x+y = y+x
I2      |-  x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z
I3      |-  x+0 = x
I4      |-  x+ (~x) = 0
I5      |-  x-y = x+(~y)
</pre>


<p> members of <tt>int</tt> form an abelian semi-group
<pre>
I6      |-  x*y = y*x
I7      |-  x*(y*z) = (x*y)*z
I8      |-  x*1 = x
</pre>


<p> to complete the ring axioms we have
<pre>
I9      |-  x*(y+z) = x*y + x*z
I10     |-  x*0 = 0
</pre>

Note that I10 follows from the other axioms.

<p>Note also that   these  ring   axioms  are   <em>not</em>  satisfied   by   any
implementation of SML, for each axiom states that a particular  computation
will terminate normally. However, many implementations of SML will raise  an
overflow exception  when asked,  for example,  to multiply  a million  by a
million using  integer  arithmetic. Even  implementations  of SML  such  as
POPLOG SML will run  out of heap in  attempting to perform computations  on
big enough integers.

<p>Our system is complementary  to the type-theory of  SML. That is  sound,
but  weak.  Our  system  is,  in  the  last  analysis,  only  sound   for a
mathematically-ideal model  of the  language, but  is logically  much  more
powerful.

<h4> The members of the type <tt>int</tt> form an integral domain</h4>

<pre>
I11   x*y = 0 |- x=0 orelse y=0
</pre>

<h4> The members of the type <tt>int</tt> form a totally ordered set.</h4>

The axioms for them to form a partially-ordered set are:
<pre>
I12   x<=y, y<=x   |-   x=y
I13   |- x<=x
I14   |- x<=y, y<=z  |- x<=z
</pre>
And to obtain total order, we add:
<pre>
I15  |- x<=y orelse y<=x

I16  |- x<=x+1
</pre>

<h4> Induction over the integers and structures </h4>

Since structural induction can be used to shorten proofs, we support
it as well as induction over the integers.





The axiom of induction for the natural numbers has to be written as a
proof-rule in our system. Now, SML does not have an explicit representation
of the natrual numbers. We have two choices: we could construct them as a
data-type, or we could regard them as a subset of the integers.
Constructing them as a data-type has some advantages: it means that we are
free to treat the -int- datatype in the way that most SML implementations
treat it, as a fixed-precision representation of a subset of the integers.

<p>However, working with user-defined natural numbers would be clumsy
notationally, so we prefer to treat them as a subset of <tt>int</tt>. With
this approach, the axiom of induction becomes:

<pre>
INDUCTION_int : (<'a> -> bool) -> theorem -> theorem -> theorem;
</pre>

<pre>

        H |- p 0              G, p(n) |- p(n+1)
       ________________________________________________

          0<=n, H |- p(n)

</pre>

It should be noted that this form admits non-standard models of the
integers.


<h3> Axioms and rules for lists. </h3>
We have a choice available here. Are we to include a structural-induction
axiom for lists, or are we going to conduct all proofs about lists in terms
of induction over the natural numbers? Structural induction is more
convenient for many proofs. Moreover, if we don't have a rule for
structural induction we will need an axiom which says that the
<tt>length</tt> function is well-defined.


<p>The list axioms are
<pre>
|- halts(x::l)
|- [] <> x::l

WRONG!!!
|- l = [] orelse l = hd(l)::tl(l)
|- hd(x::l) = x
|- tl(x::l) = l
 x<sub>1</sub>::l1 = x2::l2 |- x<sub>1</sub>=x2
 x<sub>1</sub>::l1 = x2::l2 |- l1=l2

</pre>



<h4>INDUCTION_LIST
(&lt;list> -> &lt;bool>)  -> theorem -> theorem -> theorem
</h4>
<pre>
H |- p []         H',  p l  |-  p x::l
______________________________________

       H union H' |- p l
</pre>
Where <tt>x</tt> and <tt>l</tt> are not free in G.



<h2> What we can't talk about </h2>
Our system does not allow us to manipulate type expressions. So, for example,
there is no way of saying in our system that the integers form a ring, for
example:
<pre>
    Ring(int)
</pre>
Neither can say, for example, that addition is commutative
<pre>
    commutative(op +)
</pre>

We could get round this problem by introducing the notion of a
<em>generator</em>. A generator  <tt>g</tt> for a type <b>T</b> is a
function  <tt>g:int -> <b>T</b></tt> which always returns an unspecified
member of <b>T</b> (though of course, being a function, it always returns the
same result for a given argument). With a generator, we could say:
<pre>
fun commutative f g
    f(g 1, g 2) = f(g 2, g 1);
</pre>



<h2> The Halting Rules </h2>
The interpretation that we put upon  <tt>halts(e)</tt> is that the expression
<tt>e</tt> terminates without raising an exception. This, of course, rules
out a treatment of programs which use exceptions "creatively", as a means of
specifying what is regarded as the normal flow of control.

Quid Erat Demonstrandum


<h4> Theorem  <tt>halts(a@b)</tt> </h4>



<p>Proof:

Base Case. We must try and show that <tt>halts([]@b)</tt>. So let's
assume it, and see if we can rid ourselves of the hypothesis.
<pre>
halts([]@b) |- halts([]@b)                                  ASSUME    (1)
</pre>

If we unfold the <tt>halts</tt> on the left, we may be able to massage
the resulting expression out of existence.
<pre>
halts(fn ([],b) => b
      | (a::l,b) => a::(l@b) ([],b) |- halts([]@b)          DEF_LEFT  (2)

halts ([],b) |-
    fn ([],b) => b | (a::l,b) => a::(l@b) ([],b) = b        BETA      (3)

</pre>

So now we have to show that the expression <tt>([],b)</tt> halts
for every variable <tt>b</tt>.
<pre>
|- halts []                                                 EVAL_HALTS (4)

|- halts b                                                  HALTS_VAR  (5)

|- halts ([],b)                                             HALTS_PAIR (6)

</pre>

We can now get rid of our halting condition by resolution with (3)

<pre>
|- (fn ([],b) => b | (a::l,b) => a::(l@b)) ([],b) = b       RESOLVE (7)

</pre>
So let's use this equation to simplify the hypothesis of (2).

<pre>
halts b |- halts([]@b)                                      SUBST_LEFT (8)
</pre>
And now we can trundle (5) into use, to obtain

<pre>
|- halts([]@b)                                                RESOLVE (9)
</pre>
Which concludes our base case.


<p><b>Inductive Step</b></p>
We proceed in much the same way, assume what we want to prove,
and try to massage the hypothesis, by unfolding it.

<pre>
halts(x::l@b) |- halts(x::l@b)                                ASSUME  (10)


halts(
  (fn ([],b) => b
      | (a::l,b) => a::(l@b))(x::l,b))
                    |- halts(x::l@b)                         DEF_LEFT (11)

</pre>

And, as before, we'll apply BETA and get rid of the halting condition.
<pre>
halts(x::l,b) |-
    (fn ([],b) => b
      | (a::l,b) => a::(l@b)) (x::l,b) = x::(l@b)             BETA    (12)

</pre>

But it's a rather more complicated halting condition. No matter,
we can use the halting rules for cons and pair-creation.
<pre>
|- halts x                                                 HALTS_VAR (13)

|- halts l                                                 HALTS_VAR (14)

|- halts (x::l)                                            HALTS_CONS (15)

|- halts b                                                 HALTS_VAR  (16)

|- halts (x::l,b)                                          HALTS_PAIR (17)

</pre>

Whence, resolution with (12) gets us:

<pre>
|- (fn ([],b) => b
      | (a::l,b) => a::(l@b)) (x::l,b) = x::(l@b)          RESOLVE (18)

</pre>
We can now substitute back in (11), obtaining
<pre>
halts(x::(l@b)) |- halts(x::l@b)                           SUBST_LEFT (19)
</pre>
And use the fact that list-construction halts

<pre>
halts(l@b) |- halts(l@b)                                   ASSUME (20)

|- halts x                                                 HALTS_VAR (21)

halts(l@b) |- halts(x::(l@b))                              HALTS_CONS (22)
</pre>
Resolution now gains us what we need for structural induction:

<pre>
halts(l@b) |- halts((x::l)@b)                              RESOLVE (23)

</pre>
So, finally, from induction on (9) and (23) we conclude:
<pre>
|- halts(l@b)                                              INDUCE_LIST (24)
</pre>

<h4>Theorem</h4>
<tt>length(a@b) = length(a)+length(b)</tt>

<p>Proof

<pre>
halts([]@b) |- length([]@b) = length([]@b)                 SYMMETRIC  (26)
</pre>

By resolution with (9) above
<pre>
   |- length([]@b) = length([]@b)                          REDUCE (27)
</pre>

Unfolding the right-hand call of <tt>@</tt>
<pre>
   |- length([]@b) = length(fn ([],b) => b |
        (a::l,b) => a::(l@b)) ([],b))
</pre>

....


Theorem

length l = 0 ==> l = []

Proof

Base Case

[] = []

length [] = 0





sorted a, sorted b |- sorted(merge a b)


length(a) + length(b) = 0 |- a = []


|- length(a)>=0

length(a) + length(b) = 0 |- length a + length b = 0

a>c, b>=d |- a+b>c+d


x+y = 0, x>=0, y>=0 |- x=0


x>=0 |- x=0 orelse x>0







<h3>HOL Rules not Treated </h3>


<p>Note that the <em>Abstraction</em> rule of HOL is not present in our
system, because it introduces equality between functions, and this is not
well typed in SML. We could introduce function-equality as a
meta-construct like <tt>halts</tt>, but since we can always express
<em>f=g</em> by saying that
<em>f x<sub>1</sub>...x<sub>n</sub> = g x<sub>1</sub>...x<sub>n</sub></em>
we see no need to introduce this particular meta-construct.

<p>The status of the INST_TYPE rule is not clear.

<h2>Type Correctness of Our Rules </h2>


<h2>Discussion</h2>
The axioms could be weaker.

<p>Using patterns would make life a lot easier.

<pre>
bnd = matches patt arg, halts arg |-  (fn patt => e | rest)arg =  e[bnd]
</pre>

matches p1 e1 [] =  b1, matches p2 e2 b1 = b2   |- matches p1::p2 e1::e2 b2

<b>NOTE</b> The HOL manual has simultaneous substitution, of multiple
variables, and I need to check the Meyer paper re. models of the lambda
calculus on this matter.
