<p> This  course  is  concerned  with the  study  of  <i>  programming
language paradigms </i>,  that is  the various systems  of ideas  that
have been used  to guide  the design of  programming languages.  These
paradigms are  realised  to a  greater  or lesser  extent  in  various
computer languages,  although  the  design of  a  given  language  may
reflect the influence of more than one paradigm. </p>

<p> <ul> <b>Imperative: </b> The language provides statements, such as
<i> assignment statements </i>, which explicitly change the <i>  state
</i> of the memory of the computer. </ul></p>

<p> <ul> <b>Functional: </b> In this paradigm we express  computations
as the evaluation of mathematical functions. </ul></p>


<p> <ul> <b>Logic:  </b> In  this paradigm we  express computation  in
exclusively in terms of <i> mathematical logic </i> </ul></p>

<p> <ul>  <b>Object-Oriented:  </b>  In  this  paradigm  we  associate
behaviour with data-structures called "<i> objects </i>" which belong
to <i>classes</i> which are usually structured into a hierarchy.
 </ul></p>

The paradigms  are  not  exclusive,  but reflect  the  different  emphasis  of
language designers. Most practical imperative, functional and  object-oriented
languages embody features of more than one paradigm.



<h2> <a name = "fp"> The Functional Paradigm </a> </h2>

<p>In this  we  emphasise  the  idea of  computation  as  being  about
evaluating mathematical <i> functions </i> combined in <i> expressions
</i>. While all  languages try  to provide a  representation of  basic
functions like addition, functional languages support a functional way
of expressing computations on  large and complex structures,  although
some  such  as  Scheme  also  have  imperative  features.  In  a  pure
functional language a mathematical identity like:

<pre>
         fred(x) + fred(x) = 2*fred(x)
</pre>

should hold. This  is not  necessarily the case  for a  non-functional
language, for example in Pascal or C <i>fred</i> might be a  procedure
which had a  side-effect, so  that calling  it twice  has a  different
effect from calling it once. For example <i>fred</i> might contain the
assignment <i>g:=g+1</i>  where <i>g</i>  is  a global  variable.  The
primary motivation  of writing  functionally  is to  develop  programs
whose behaviour can easily be analysed mathematically, and in any case
is easy to predict and understand.</p>

<p>The same non-functional aspect holds also for Java. A method call
<i>fred(x)</i> will commonly have a side-effect.</p>

<p>However it has been difficult to design languages under the functional
paradigm
which produce  programs which  run  as fast  as under  the  imperative
paradigm. With the high performance of modern computers, this  matters
less for many  applications than the  ability to write  <i>correct</i>
programs. The  functional paradigm  is hard  to implement  efficiently
because if a storage location is once  used to hold a value it is  not
obvious when it can  be re-used - a  computer running a program  using
the functional  paradigm can  spend a  lot of  effort determining  the
reusability of store.</p>

<p>Another way to think of the  functional paradigm is to regard it  as a
way of taking to its limit
the advice to avoid harmful side-effects in a program.</p>


<h2> <a name = "ip"> The Imperative Paradigm </a> </h2>


Languages which  reflect  this  paradigm recognise  the  fact  computers  have
re-usable  memory  that  can  change  state.  So  they  are  characterised  by
<i>statements</i>, which affect the state of the machine, for example.

<ul><pre> x := x+1 </pre></ul>

<p>This can only be understood  mathematically by associating a
sequence of   values    with   <i>x</i>    let   us    say
<i>x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>,...</i>, where  <i>x<sub>t</sub></i>
denotes  the  value the variable  <i>x</i>  has at  some  time
<i>t</i>.  Thus  the  above statement can be translated into
mathematics as</p>

<ul> x<sub>t+1</sub> = x<sub>t</sub> + 1 </ul>



<p>This kind of reasoning is discussed in CS250. It gets  increasingly
hard to  do  as the  state-changes  get  ever more  complex  (e.g.  by
assigning to data-structure components). However imperative  languages
can relatively easily be  translated into efficient machine-code,  and
so are usually  considered to  be highly efficient.  Many people  also
find the imperative paradigm  to be a more  natural way of  expressing
themselves.</p>

Languages which use the imperative paradigm commonly have functional
features - for example the basic functions of arithmetic (addition,
subtraction...) are provided.

<h2> <a name = "lp"> The Logic Paradigm </a> </h2>

<p>While the functional paradigm emphasises the idea of a mathematical
function, the logic paradigm focusses on predicate logic, in which the
basic concept is  a <i>relation</i>.  Logic languages  are useful  for
expressing problems where it is not obvious what the functions  should
be. Thus, for example where people are concerned, it is natural to use
relations.</p>

<p>For example consider the <i>uncle</i> relationship: a given  person
can have many <i>uncles</i>, and a another person can be  <i>uncle</i>
to many <i>nieces</i> and <i>nephews</i>. </p>

<p>Let us consider now how we can define the <i>brother</i>  relation
in terms  of  simpler  relations  and  properties  <i>father,  mother,
male</i>. Using the Prolog logic language one can say:</p>

<pre>

    brother(X,Y)      /* X is the brother of Y                    */
        :-            /* if there are two people F and M for which*/
        father(F,X),  /*          F is the father of X            */
        father(F,Y),  /*    and   F is the father of Y            */
        mother(M,X),  /*    and   M is the mother of X            */
        mother(M,Y),  /*    and   M is the mother of Y            */
        male(X).      /*    and   X is male                       */
</pre>


<p> That is <i>X</i> is the brother of <i>Y</i> if they have the  same
father and mother and <i>X</i>  is male. Here "<i>:-</i>" stands  for
logical implication (written right to left). </p>

<p>
Mathematical logic  has always  had an  important role  in computation,  since
boolean logic is the basis of the design of the logic circuits which form  the
basis of any computer. In  the logic paradigm we make  use of a more  advanced
construct, namely predicate logic, to give us languages of enhanced expressive
power.</p>


<h2> <a name = "oop"> The Object-Oriented Paradigm</a> </h2>


<p>The Object Oriented  paradigm (often written  O-O) focusses on  the
<i> objects </i> that a program is representing, and on allowing  them
to exhibit "behaviour". This is  contrasted with the typical  approach
in the <i>imperative</i>  paradigm, in which  one typically thinks  of
operating on <i>data</i> with <i>procedures</i>. In the imperative
paradigm typically the data are passive,
the procedures are active. In the O-O paradigm, data is combined  with
procedures to give <i>objects</i>, which are thereby rendered  active.
For example in the  imperative paradigm, one  would write a  procedure
which prints the various  kinds of object in  the program. In the  O-O
paradigm, each object  has a  <i>print-method</i>, and  you "tell"  an
object to print itself. </p>

<p>
It is however possible to use certain non object-oriented languages
to write object-oriented programs. What is required is the ability to
create data-structures that contain machine code, or pointers to
machine code. This is possible in the C language and in most functional
languages (where functions are represented as as code).
</p>

<p>Objects belong to <em>classes</em>.
Typically, all the objects in a given class
will have the same kinds of behaviour.

<p>Classes are usually arranged in some kind of <em>class hierarchy</em>.
This hierarchy can be thought of as representing a <em>"kind of"</em>
relation. For example, a computational model of the University might
need a class <tt>person</tt> to represent the various people who make up
the University. A sub-class of <tt>person</tt> might be a <tt>student</tt>;
students are a kind of person. Another sub-class might be
<tt>professor</tt>. Both students and professors can exhibit the same kinds
of behaviour, since they are both people. They both eat drink and sleep,
for example. But there are  kinds of behaviour that
are distinctive: professors pontificate for example.</p>

<h2> <a name = "scm"> The Scheme Language</a> </h2>

<p>This
course is taught using the language Scheme which provides good support of
the functional paradigm,  since it  contains a functional  subset. However  it
also contains  imperative  features,  which  mean that  we  can  look  at  the
imperative paradigm within Scheme. It is a simple language but powerful enough
to let us easily implement extensions which illustrate both the logic paradigm
and the object-oriented paradigm.</p>

<p>In
particular, it is quite easy  to implement the object-oriented paradigm  in
Scheme because the  functions available in  Scheme can easily  be attached  to
Scheme data-structures providing in effect objects that have behaviour arising
from the attached functions.</p>
