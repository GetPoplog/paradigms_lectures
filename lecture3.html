<h2><a name = "comments">Comments begin with a semicolon</a></h2>

To insert a comment in a scheme program, just type the semicolon character.
The whole line after the comment will be ignored.

<h2><a name = "interact">
Remember - all expressions in this file can be evaluated
</a></h2>

You will find it worthwhile to read these notes on-line using UMASS  Scheme
as a browser because every Scheme expression occurring on a line by  itself
can be run. You can then try changing it and seeing what happens. Do not be
afraid of playing with the machine - you cannot break it!

<p>[Note
- this  file currently exists in two forms - the HTML version which
is the one you are reading, and a (nearly) plain-vanilla ASCII form which
is what you get when you use the menus in UMASS Scheme. The ASCII form is
the one you should execute. The eventual plan is to modify UMASS Scheme to
read HTML files as a (rather limited) Web Browser, so that only the one set
of text for the course is needed]</p>

<h2><a name="special">Special Forms are not evaluated in the usual
way.</a></h2>

As we  have seen  the  standard way  to evaluate  a  Scheme expression  is  to
evaluate the function and  arguments and then to  <em>apply</em>
the function to  the
arguments.

<p>
This rule does not hold for certain <i>special forms</i>.
Examples of special
forms we have  seen so far are:</p>

<code>
   (lambda (x) (* x x))
</code>

we can think of this as having a pattern described by:

<pre>
   (lambda <b>formals body </b>)
</pre>

You  can  think  of  this  as  evaluating  to  itself,  with  a  rule   for
<em>applying</em> it to arguments (strip off lambda and substitute...)


<h3><a name="define">Defining a variable</a></h3>
<pre>
   (define <b>variable expression</b>)
</pre>

This special  form evaluates  the  <b>expression</b>
and  <e>binds</e>  the
variable to the resulting value.

There is a shorthand way of defining a function

<pre>
   (define <b>form body</b>)
</pre>

is a variant of  the <tt>&#160;  define    </tt>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
special form.  Here <b>form&#160; </b> is  in
effect an expression of the form:


<pre>
     (<b>variable</b> <b>arg<sub>1</sub></b> ....<b>arg<sub>n</sub></b>)
</pre>

where <b>variable</b> is the name of the function being defined and

<pre>
    <b>arg<sub>1</sub></b> ... <b>arg<sub>n</sub></b>
</pre>

are formal parameters. For example:


<pre>
    (define (square x) (* x x))
</pre>

is a convenient way of defining the <tt>&#160; square </tt>&#160; function.

However this kind of definition is only a convenience. So:

<pre>
   (define  (<b>variable</b> <b>arg<sub>1</sub></b> ....<b>arg<sub>n</sub></b>) <b>body</b>)
</pre>

is exactly equivalent to


<pre>
   (define  <b>variable</b>
        (lambda (<b>arg<sub>1</sub></b> ....<b>arg<sub>n</sub></b>) <b>body</b>)
</pre>



[Remark: in the Lambda Calculus, there is only ONE special form, namely lambda
abstraction.  Having  a  small  number  of  special  forms  is  mathematically
desirable, since the  number of  different cases to  consider in  mathematical
analysis is reduced.]

<h2><a name="BVF">Boolean valued functions usually end in ?</a></h2>

Functions which return a boolean value (<tt>#t</tt>&#160;
or <tt> #f</tt>&#160;) are often called
"<em>predicates</em>".

By convention,  predicates have  a  name which  ends  in a  question  mark.
Certain common predicates like '&lt;' are exceptions to this rule.


<h1><a name="types">Scheme Types.</a></h1>

Objects which can exist in an  implementation of Scheme belong to exactly  one
basic type. A Scheme  implementation that meets the  IEEE standard for  Scheme
must provide the following basic types:

<pre>
    boolean,char,null,number,pair,
    procedure,string,symbol,vector
</pre>

It may provide others.

The type of  a given object  is recognised  by one of  the following
built-in functions.

<pre>
    boolean?
    char?
    null?
    number?
    pair?
    procedure?
    string?
    symbol?
    vector?
</pre>


That is  these predicates  recognise object  types which  do <b>not</b>
overlap -
there  may  be  others,  e.g.   files,  and,  in  some  environments,   the
<em>widgets</em>  or   <em>windows</em>   which  support   graphical   user
interfaces.

In this class we shall not be concerned with the types <em>vector,
char</em>.

<h3><a name = "atom">Atoms</a></h3>

The <tt>pair</tt> datatype is commonly used in Scheme to build most complex
data-structures - that is those that have sub-structures. Often, we speak
of any data-object that is not a pair as being an <em>atom</em>.


<h2><a name = "if">
The (if <b>condition</b> <b>expr1</b> <b>expr2</b>) construction
</a></h2>

Scheme provides <em> conditional expressions</em> in
which  a condition (an  expression
which can have a boolean  value) or conditions are  used to choose which  of a
number of other expressions is to be evaluated.

The simplest form of conditional in Scheme is the special form:

<pre>
    (if <b>condition</b> <b>expr1</b> <b>expr2</b>)
</pre>

It evaluates <b>condition</b>. Unless the  <b>condition</b> evaluates to  #f then  the
result of the if  expression is obtained  by evaluating <b>expr1</b>  otherwise
the result is obtained by evaluating <b>expr2</b>.

[WHY does it have to be a special form? Could it NOT be a special form? ].

<h2><a name="arithmetic">Arithmetic in Scheme</a></h2>


Arithmetic operations are denoted by the  conventional  symbols:

<pre>
    +
    -
    *
    /
</pre>

There are also the usual  algebraic and trancendental functions. They  operate
on  integers,  rationals,  floating-point  representation  of  reals,  complex
numbers. Try:


<pre>
    (sqrt -1)
</pre>

the answer is the complex number:

<pre>
    0.0+1.0i
</pre>

Numbers can also be compared. There is a predicate


<pre>
    zero?
</pre>

which recognises whether a number is zero.

Comparisons between real numbers are denoted by the conventional symbols.

<pre> &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=
</pre>

<h2><a name="factorial">The factorial function - an example of
recursion</a></h2>

The well known factorial function can be defined using the recurrence
relations:

<pre>
    0! = 1
    n! = n(n-1)!
</pre>

These translate into scheme as follows:

<pre>
(define (factorial n)
    (if (= n 0)
        1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))


(factorial 5)

120
</pre>

Try <tt>&#160; (factorial 1000)</tt>&#160;, and <tt>&#160; (/(factorial  1000)
(factorial 999))</tt>).

<h2><a name="eager">Scheme evaluates expressions in an Eager way.</a></h2>

The rule that Scheme evaluates the arguments of an expression before  applying
the function is called <em>eager</em> evaluation, or
<em>call-by-value</em>.

Some functional  languages,  such  as  Haskell,  are  <em>lazy</em>,
and  evaluate  no
expression unless it is actually needed.

They have a better logical  structure (e.g. <tt>if&#160;</tt>&#160;
does not  need to be a  special
form in these languages), but are hard to make efficient.

<h2><a name="quote">Quoted Expressions are Compound Data.</a></h2>

So far we have seen that Scheme has numbers, booleans and functions as objects
that a program can use.  These are simple data-types,  which we can regard  as
having no internal structure to be explored.

Scheme has a very simple and elegant approach to providing complex data-types:

<em>any</em>
expression can be <em>quoted</em>.
That is to say, Scheme expressions can be
regarded both as <em>program-like-objects</em> and as <em>data objects</em>

The long-hand way to do this is to use the special form:


<pre>
     (quote <b>expression</b>)
</pre>

For example

<pre>
     (quote (+ 3 4))
</pre>

evaluates to the expression:


<pre>
     (+ 3 4)
</pre>

Quotation is very common, so we allow


<pre>
      '<b>expression</b>
</pre>

as a shorthand. For example:


<pre>
      '(+ 3 4)
</pre>

<p>[Note that this single quote is <em>not</em>
a special form, but a syntactic shorthand
for the corresponding expression using <tt>&#160; quote</tt>&#160;&#160;].
</p>


<h4><a name="car">Basic list-accessing functions</a></h4>

Such  a   quoted   expression   can   be  regarded   as   a   <em>list   of
sub-expressions</em> of  which  the  first is  the  function-name  and  the
subsequent  ones  are  the   arguments.  The  Scheme  functions   <tt>&#160;
car&#160;</tt>&#160;
and <tt>&#160; cdr&#160;&#160;</tt>&#160; allow us to access the components
of this list. <tt>&#160; (car <b>list</b>)&#160;</tt>&#160;
evaluates to the  first
member of the list,  while <tt>&#160; (cdr <b>list</b>)&#160;</tt>&#160;
evaluates
to the remaining members.


<pre>
       (car '(+ 3 4))
</pre>

evaluates to


<pre>
       +
</pre>

while


<pre>
       (cdr '(+ 3 4))
</pre>

evaluates to


<pre>
       (3 4)
</pre>

and

<pre>
      (car (cdr '(+ 2 3))
</pre>

evaluates to


<pre>
      2
</pre>

As well as quoting expressions that "make  sense" in Scheme, such as
<tt>&#160; '(+ 2  3)</tt>&#160;
we can also use the quote notation just to make lists. For example


<pre>
     '(1 2 3 4)
</pre>

is a list of four natural numbers.

<p>You can quote numbers and other constant objects, but, since they evaluate to
themselves, there is no point.


<h4><a name="cadr">Convenient list-accessing functions</a></h4>

<p>Scheme implementations provide convenience functions for accessing lists. For
example

<pre>
 (cadr x)  =  (car (cdr x))
 (caddr x) = (car (cdr (cdr x)))
</pre>

[Note -  <tt>&#160;  car</tt>&#160;  and <tt>&#160;  cdr</tt>&#160;  are  funny
names, derived from the assembly code of an antique IBM computer.]

<h2><a name="nil">The empty list</a></h2>

The empty  list, denoted  by &#160;<tt>&#160; '() &#160;</tt>&#160;
has  no  elements  in it.  It is  a  distinct
data-type.

The predicate:

<pre>
    null?
</pre>

recognises the empty list. It is an error to apply the functions
<tt>&#160; car</tt>&#160;
or  <tt>&#160;&#160; cdr</tt>&#160;&#160;
to the empty list.


<pre>
    (car '())

<h2><a name="cons">Making Lists.</a></h2>

Quotation allows us to  make constant lists. However  we also want to  allow a
program to make lists that the programmer has not explicitly created. This  is
done with the function <tt>&#160; cons</tt>&#160;

<pre>
     (cons x y)
</pre>

makes a list whose <tt>&#160; car</tt>&#160;
is <tt>&#160; x</tt>&#160; and whose  <tt>&#160; cdr</tt>&#160; is <tt>&#160; y</tt>&#160;.
So to make a list  containing
just the number <tt>&#160; 23</tt>&#160; we do:


<pre>
   (cons 23 '())

    (23)
</pre>


Now let's define a function to make a "sandwich" list:


<pre>
(define (sandwich x y)
    (cons x (cons y (cons x '()))))
</pre>

So:

<code>
    (sandwich 1 2 )
</code>

evaluates to:

<pre>
    (1 2 1)
</pre>


<h2><a name="identities">Two Identities which hold for Scheme
Lists</a></h2>


Scheme is subject to the mathematical laws:

<pre>
    (car (cons x y)) = x
    (cdr (cons x y)) = y
</pre>


<h2><a name="symbol">Symbols</a></h2>

<p> An isolated Scheme identifier can be quoted, for example <tt>  'a</tt>.
As such, it  is called a  <em>symbol</em>, and is  a member of  one of  the
basic datatypes of Scheme. </p>

A symbol is recognised by <tt>symbol?</tt>.

<p>
Scheme has the convention that all  letters occurring in a symbol are  coerced
into being lower case.
</p>

<pre>
  'CaT
</pre>

<p>
evaluates to the symbol:
</p>

<pre>
  cat
</pre>

<p>
This reflects the fact that Scheme converts all identifiers to lower case  (as
Pascal does, and C does not).
