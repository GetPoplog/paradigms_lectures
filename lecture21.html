<h2>1  We usually restrict ourselves to Horn clauses in the logic
paradigm</h2> </a>

<p>
So far  we  have considered  resolution  in  the full  first  order  predicate
calculus. However in the logic paradigm  it is customary to restrict the  kind
of clauses  we  are  allowed to  write  in  exchange for  the  possibility  of
efficient implementation  of  the  logic  on  a  computer.  The  most  serious
restriction is  that we  allow  <em>only one  positive  literal</em> per
clause.  Such clauses are called "Horn clauses". In terms of implication, a
Horn clause

<pre>
        ~a&#160;<sub>1</sub> \/ ~a&#160;<sub>2</sub> \/ ... ~a&#160;<sub>n</sub> \/ b
</pre>

<p>
can be regarded as a implication:

<pre>
       (a<sub>1</sub> &amp; a<sub>2</sub> &amp; ...... a<sub>n</sub>) -> b
</pre>

Moreover this is commonly  given an <em>operational
interpretation</em>  in which <tt>b</tt>  is regarded as a kind of
<em>procedure</em>.

<p>
In the Prolog language, for example, a Horn clause is written

<pre>
    <b>consequence</b> :- <b>premises</b>
</pre>

<p>
where the <consequence> is  the single unit clause,  and the premises are  the
negative literals separated by commas. Thus we might define:

<pre>
        grandparent(X,Y) :- parent(X,Z), parent(Z,Y).
</pre>

<p>
where <tt>X, Y</tt> and  <tt>Z</tt> are  variables,  according  to the
Prolog convention  of capitalising variables.

<p>
Let us  write Horn clauses as, for example:


<pre>
       (or (grandparent (? x) (? y))
           (not (parent (? x) (? z)))
           (not (parent (? z) (? y))))
</pre>

<h2>2  Viewing Clauses as Procedures
</h2>

<p> Such  a  clause  can  be  regarded as  a  kind  of  a  definition  of a
<em>procedure</em> <tt>grandparent</tt>. From  this operational  viewpoint,
<tt>(? x)</tt> and <tt>(? y)</tt>  are formal parameters of the  procedure,
while <tt>(? z)</tt> is a local variable. Whereas in Scheme all  parameters
are called by  <em> value</em>,  in the operational  interpretation of  the
logic  paradigm   we   regard   all   parameters   as   being   called   by
<em>reference</em>. So if we regard the clause above as a kind of procedure
definition we see the following correspondence:</p>

<p>
So, the negated form of our theorem, for example

<pre>
       (not (grandparent Liz (? p)))
</pre>

<p>
can be  regarded as  a <em>call</em>  of  our procedure
<tt>grandparent</tt>.

<h3>2.1  Matching constant parameters</h3>


<p>
Notice that  one difference  between this  and Pascal  is that  if you  pass a
constant as actual parameter, instead of getting an error report if you try to
bind it inside the procedure, a logic language will try to match the constant.
Here you could think of the <tt>(? p)</tt>  in the call as a kind of
call-by-reference
(although the logic paradigm extends this concept rather far).

<h3>2.2  Procedure Activations Persist after Procedure returns result</h3>


<p>
Another important difference is that the <tt>grandparent</tt>
procedure activation does
not cease to exist when  it returns a result. Rather  it is kept around to  be
re-activated if the result is not  satisfactory. This corresponds to the  fact
that a clause can be resolved with several other clauses.

<p>
[Some implementations of Scheme allow you to write Scheme functions that  have
the same property - they provide  a function named <tt>call/cc</tt>
(call with  current
continuation) which preserves the state of a computation to be re-activated at
a later time.]

<h3>2.3  Procedure Definitions may be Distributed over Clauses</h3>


<p>
Finally, let us  notice that the  definition of a  predicate-procedure can  be
spread over more  than one  case. For example,  suppose we  had expressed  our
family relations in terms of <tt>mother</tt> and <tt>father</tt>
then we might have


<pre>
    (or (grandmother (? x) (? y))
        (not (mother (? x) (? z))) (not (mother (? z) (? y))))

    (or (grandmother (? x) (? y))
        (not (mother (? x) (? z))) (not (father (? z) (? y))))
</pre>

<p>
We shall  see  this  kind  of  distribution  of  a  definition  among  several
statements that may  be widely  separated in the  program text  in the  Object
Oriented Paradigm.

<h3>2.4  Unit Clauses Record Basic Facts</h3>


<p>
Now let us consider <em>unit clauses</em>. Operationally two clauses such
as

<pre>
    (parent Liz Charley)
    (parent Charley Will)
</pre>

<p>
can be regarded as defining a single procedure <tt>parent</tt>. We could
think of this as a succinct way of defining a conditional.

<p>
So let us consider the query

<pre>
    (not (grandparent Liz (? p)))
</pre>

<p>
this "calls the procedure" <tt>grandparent</tt>,
requiring us to perform the calls

<pre>
     (not (parent Liz (? z)))  (not (parent (? z) (? p)))
</pre>

<p>
performing the first call of <tt>parent</tt>
we bind <tt>(? z)</tt> to  <tt>Charley</tt>. Performing the
second call, we bind the variable <tt>(? p)</tt> to the value
<tt>Will</tt>.


<a name = "arith">
<h2>3  Arithmetic and other operations can be built in </h2></a>

<p>
Computers have a lot of built-in arithmetic capability. We could construct our
arithmetic from logical first principles, for example by translating the Peano
postulates into predicate calculus. However it would be much more efficient to
make  use  of  built-in  arithmetic  capabilities.

<h3>3.1  Building in arithmetic predicates like &lt;</h3>

<p>
Consider the "less-than" relationship of arithmetic. A good implementation  of
the logic paradigm should behave exactly  as if there were an infinite  number
of unit clauses such as

<pre>
    (or (&lt; 1 2))
    (or (&lt; 1 3))
    (or (&lt; 1 4))
    ...
    (or (&lt; 2 3))
    ...
</pre>

<p>
It should be noted that the  best-known implementation of the Logic  Paradigm,
namely the  Prolog language,  has a  half-baked implementation  of  arithmetic
comparison - both  arguments of &lt;  and other arithmetic  operators have to  be
instantiated to numbers if an error message is to be avoided.

<h3>3.2  Building in arithmetic functions like +</h3>


<p>
Arithmetic functions can also be built in. Given that logic programs behave as
procedural rather  than  functional  languages, the  most  consistent  way  of
implementing such  functions would  be to  represent them  as predicates.  For
example one might write <tt>(add 2 3 (? x))</tt>
and expect <tt>(? x)</tt> to be bound
to  <tt>5</tt>.
However this is a very tedious way of specifying arithmetic, so the convention
is to introduce an <em>evaluation
predicate</em> which evaluates an expression. In  our
Scheme-based formalism one would write:

<pre>
        (is (? x) (+ 2 3))
</pre>

<p>
Again, the logic-languages behave to some extent as if there were an infinite
number of unit clauses which said, for example


<pre>
        (is 5 (+ 2 3))
</pre>

<p>
however they do not behave consistently.

<p>
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
Would  the Peano  postulates  translate into  first-order  predicate
calculus?


<a name = "function">
<h2>4  Function symbols provide the ability to create data-structures.</h2>
</a>

<p>
So far we have confined ourselves in  our examples to what is often  called
the "datalog" paradigm, that is to say the arguments of the predicates have
been simple  variables, numbers  or  other constants.  At this  level,  the
capabilities of languages  of the logic  paradigm such as  Prolog, and  the
capabilities of <em>relational databases</em> are very similar. In a sense,
logic languages  tend to  work  more lazily  - they  "think"  of a  way  of
satisfying a predicate  and postpone thinking  of any other  way until  the
first way is proved wrong. Relational  databases work more eagerly. In  the
grandparent case, a  relational database  would think of  all the  possible
pairs of people who had that relationship and then might allow the user  to
choose the particular one she wanted.

<p>
However our  version of  the predicate  calculus allows  us to  have  function
symbols. These allow us in effect to build data-structures.

<h3>4.1  Determining if a given element is a member of a list</h3>


<pre>
    (or (member (? x) (cons (? x) (? y))))                            ;(1)
    (or (member (? x) (cons (? y) (? z))) (not (member (? x) (? z)))) ;(2)
</pre>

<p>
Now consider the "goal":

<pre>
    (not (member 2 (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil)))))    ;(3)
</pre>

<p>
This generates the sub-goal, with the substitution <tt>((? y) . 1)</tt>

<pre>
    (not (member 2 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil))))
</pre>

<p>
And now  with the  substitution  <tt>((?
x)  .  2)</tt>, we  get  the empty  clause  by
resolution with (1). So the original goal is satisfied.

<p>
Now consider:

<pre>
    (or (not (member (? p) (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil)))))
                (not (> (? p) 1)))                                      ;(4)
</pre>

<p>
This resolves with (1) to give the binding <tt>((? p) . 1)</tt>
and the new goal

<pre>
    (not (> 1 1))
</pre>

<p>
However this goal cannot  be satisfied by resolution  against anything in  the
(implicit) database of numeric facts since the (false) fact <tt>(or
(> 1 1))</tt>  does
not occur in there. So our first result from the <tt>member</tt>
procedure is no  good.
However we can resuscitate it, by using clause (2)! From (4) and (2) we obtain

<pre>
      (or
         (not (member (? x) (cons 2 (cons 3 nil))))
         (not (> (? p) 1)))
</pre>

<p>
The first clause now resolves against (1) giving <tt>((?
x) . 2)</tt> , leaving us with

<pre>
         (not (> 2 1))
</pre>

<p>
which resolves  against the  implicit clause  <tt>(or
(>  2 1))</tt> in the  database,
leaving us the empty clause.


<h3>4.2  Building a new list with concatenation</h3>


<p>
Now let us consider a more complicated example. We might define
<tt>append</tt> as:

<pre>
    (or (append nil (? list) (? list)))         ;[1]

    (or                                         ;[2]
        (append
            (cons (? x) (? list1))
            (? list2)
            (cons (? x) (? list3)))
        (not
            (append (? list1) (? list2) (? list3))))
</pre>


<p>
Now consider the goal:

<pre>
    (not (append (cons 1 nil) (cons 2 nil) (? listout)))      ;[3]
</pre>

<p>
This resolves with [2] with the unification

<pre>
    (                                                         ;[U1]
        ((? x) . 1)
        ((? list1) . nil)
        ((? list2) (cons 2 nil))
        ((? listout) (cons 1 (? list3)))
        )
</pre>

<p>
giving the new goal

<pre>
    (not (append nil (cons 2 nil) (? list3)))                ;[4]
</pre>


<p>
we can now use clause [1] to obtain the unification

<pre>
    (((? list3) (cons 2 nil)))                               ;[U2]
</pre>

<p>
satisfying the goal, since [1] is a unit clause. We can get the actual
value of <tt>(? listout)</tt> by using the two unifying substitutions [U1]
and [U2]. From U1 we obtain

<pre>
        (cons 1 (? list3))
</pre>

<p>
as the value for <tt>(? listout)</tt>, and from [U2] this is seen to be


<pre>
        (cons 1 (cons 2 nil))
</pre>
