<p>
To start up UMASS scheme type <tt>scheme</tt>
as a Unix command. You will get a message
like this:
</p>


<pre>
  Sussex Poplog (Version 14.5 Tue Feb 22 15:01:28 WET 1994)
  UMASS Scheme (Version 1.0)
  initialising X windows

  Sussex XVed (Version 2.0 (motif), SCHEME Tue Sep 12 12:14:16 EDT 1995)
  X Server: MIT X Consortium
  initialising X windows
</pre>

<p>[Note for experts: getting UMASS Scheme depends on an alias in  the
class  <tt>.cshrc</tt>  file,  which   itself  depends  on  your   own
<tt>~/.cshrc</tt> file. If you change this file, you may find yourself
running a  version MIT  Scheme which  does NOT  accord with  the  IEEE
standard required for this class.</p>

<p>UMASS  Scheme  is  implemented  under  the  Sussex  Poplog   system
developed at Sussex University (Falmer  UK), and employs the  X-window
system developed at MIT (Cambridge MA). ] </p>

<p>If you are logged in in the EDLAB, you will get a version which  is
customised for running under X-windows.  In this version, you will  be
able to edit and test programs entirely within UMASS Scheme system  if
you wish.</p>

<p> If you are logged in remotely,  for example from home, and do  not
have an X-server  on your  local machine, you  will get  a version  of
UMASS  Scheme  which  is  customised  for  running  under  a  terminal
emulator. If your emulator  matches a VT100  terminal, this should  be
OK, but you  may need  to set the  <tt>term</tt> environment  variable
before you run your Scheme. If Scheme is unhappy with your terminal it
will say so.</p>

<ul><code>
   setenv term vt100
</code></ul>


<p>
If you are logged in remotely from a machine which is running an X-server, for
example another workstation in UMASS, or your own machine running an
X-server using the ppp protocol, you should do:
</p>


<code><ul>
   setenv DISPLAY <b>mymachine</b>
</ul></code>


<p>
where <b>mymachine</b>
is the net-address of the machine you are logged in on. This
will allow UMASS Scheme to open windows on your machine.

<h2><a name = "edit"> Editing Files and Running Scheme Code.</a></h2>


<p>
Under X-windows, a small  "control panel" will pop-up  when you start  Scheme.
This has a  box labelled "File:".  This contains  the name of  a default  file
(<tt>"unnamed.scm"</tt>)
that you can edit using  the built-in VED editor. If you  want
to change this, put the mouse in the  box, drag the mouse along the length  of
the name - it will now reverse its colours. Then type in the name of the  file
you want to edit, and hit the Do Edit button. After a brief pause a new window
will appear with your file (possibly empty) in it.
</p>


<p>
If it is a file  to contain text in the  Scheme language, the name should  end
with "<tt>.scm</tt>".
</p>

<p>
There is also "<b>Exit</b>" button to kill the Scheme system.
</p>


<p>
Each edit window contains a "menu-bar" across the top. This is used in a style
akin to  that  of  the  Macintosh. Currently  this  has  the  following  menus
attached:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b> File </b>
Allows you to choose to open a new file for editing, to
save it
to
        backing store, to save it under another name, to write it under
        another name, to insert the contents of a file, and to
        "quit" that is to stop editing that particular file.
<p>
        Note that most of the file options use a "File Tool" which allows you
        to select the file to operate on interactively. This looks a bit
        complicated, but you can always type the name of the file you want
        in the Selection: slot, and hit the "Edit" button.

<li><b>
Edit</b>
This menu allows you to cut, copy and paste pieces of your document.
        Again, the style is Macintosh-like. You can paste into other windows
        on your machine which are not related to UMASS Scheme, although you
        should note that the mouse-button conventions are usually different.
        You use the LEFT mouse button to select an arbitrary piece of text.
<p>
        You can also select a "range" of text. To do this, hold down the
        control key (ctrl) and use left mouse button to select a number of
        lines of text. The selected range is indicated by a black line that
        appears down the left of your screen.
<p>

        A Search function is also provided.


<li><b>
View</b>
This allows you to go to the start or end of the file, or of a
        procedure.



<li><b>
Compile</b>
This menu allows you to compile program text. Scheme uses an
        incremental compiler, so it is possible to compile a line of text,
        a single function definition (use the current procedure menu item)
        or the text of a range or selection. You can also choose to compile
        a file selected with a File Tool.


<li><b>
Lectures</b> This gives you access to all the lectures of the course.



<li><b>
cs287</b>
This menu allows you to access information specific to the class.
        It will be added to as time goes on.


</ul>



<p>
Additional help with editing is found under the "<tt>287</tt>"
menu. This
online
material is found in the directory <tt>$popscheme</tt>.
</p>


<h2><a name = "font"> Changing your default font for VED under
X.</a></h2>

If you want to use a different font, add a line of the form XVed*font: <font>
to your .Xdefaults file. You can obtain a (long) listing of available fonts
by doing xlsfonts as a Unix command.


<pre>
XVed*font: 7x12  # The default size - rather small for some.
XVed*font: 9x15  # A bigger size, which you may like better.
</pre>

<p>You can also change the font of a
particular window by doing</p>

<ul>    <tt>&lt;enter&gt; window font <b>font</b></tt>.
</ul>

Where <b> font</b> is the name of a font.

<h1> The Scheme Language </h1>

<h2> <a name = "typographic">
Typographic conventions used in these Lectures
</a></h2>

<p>All expressions and other constructs of the Scheme language which occur
in these lectures are set in a typewriter font, An example of typewriter
font is <tt> (define pi 3.14159) </tt>.

<p>Typewriter
fonts  are  characterised  by being  fixed-width  (every  letter
occupies the same amount of space on  the page). In the HTML browser  which
is being  constructed to  let you  view these  lectures from  within  UMASS
Scheme, Scheme expressions will appear in red, since the VED editor  always
uses a single fixed-width font and provides no means of distinguishing text
by using a different font, only by making variants on a given font.

<p>Where it is important to make an
expression of the language stand out, it will be placed indented as a  line
or lines of text separated from the English commentary. For example:

<ul><pre>
    (define pi 3.14159)
</pre></ul>

<p>Grammatical constructs are specified using a bold version of the
typewriter font. For example, we specify one form of the Scheme <tt> define
</tt> statement by

<ul><pre>
    (define <b> variable  expression</b>)
</pre></ul>

<p>Here, because <tt><b>variable</b></tt> is in a bold font it means that
you can write <i>any</i> Scheme variable in place of it; likewise because
<tt><b>expression</b></tt> is in a bold font it means that you can write
<i>any</i> Scheme expression in place of it. So, the previous statement:

<ul><pre>
    (define pi 3.14159)
</pre></ul>

is an instance of the grammatical form

<ul><pre>
    (define <b> variable  expression</b>)
</pre></ul>

<h2><a name = "values"> Simple values in Scheme </a></h2>

<p>
Scheme operates on the usual simple data-objects, that is to say data-objects
that can best be thought of as having no internal structure.
</p>

<ul>
<p>
<b>integers:</b>  These are of <i> arbitrary precision </i>
that is they are only limited in size by the total amount of memory
you have!
</p>


<p>
<b>rationals:</b>
Scheme can and will compute with fractions. If you divide one
           integer by another you will get a rational. You should usually
           avoid rational computations, unless you are doing symbolic algebra!
</p>


<p>
<b>reals:</b>     These are represented by floating point numbers.
</p>

<p>
<b>booleans:</b>
These are #f (false) and #t (true). [NOTE for experts:
            unlike non IEEE Schemes and most Lisps, the empty list '()
            is not a false truth value.]
</p>
</ul>

<pre>
23   is an integer
3.4  is a real
3/4  is a rational (WARNING - UMASS Scheme does not currently input rationals
                    but it will generate them and print them out).
</pre>


<h2><a name = "variables"> Variables in Scheme </a></h2>

<p>
A scheme variable is  a sequence of  letters (a..z A..Z)  or digits (0..9)  or
signs (+  - *  / ...)  which are  terminated by  "white-space" or  by  certain
special characters, of which parentheses are the most important. In fact, most
combinations of non-whitespace characters which  Scheme does not recognise  as
being a number are treated as a variable. Usually, people will choose  helpful
names for variables.
</p>


<p>
For example the following are variables:
</p>


<pre><code>
        x y x_23 34x the-fat-cat + +1
</code></pre>


<p>
Warning - Scheme gives some variables <i>initial values</i>,
for example <tt>+,
*, / </tt>. It is not a good idea to use these variables for
your own purposes!
</p>




<h2><a name = "define"> <tt> define </tt> creates a new
variable, gives it a value</a></h2>


<p> Variables usually have values. We  say that a variable is  <i>bound</i>
to  a  value  when   it  is  associated  with   the  value.  Scheme   has a
<i>statement</i> which creates a new variable and binds it to the value  of
an expression </p>



<ul><pre>
    (define <b> variable  expression</b>)
</pre></ul>

<p>
For example:
</p>


<ul><pre>
    (define pi 3.14159)
</pre></ul>


<p>
binds the variable <tt>pi</tt> to have the value <tt>3.14159</tt>
</p>


<h2><a name = "expr"> Expressions in Scheme</a></h2>


<p>
Expressions have  a very  uniform syntax  in Scheme.  An expression  can  be a
constant or a variable,  or it can  be a sequence  of expressions enclosed  in
parentheses (sometimes called a <i>combination</i>).
</p>



<p> In the case of a combination, the first expression is regarded  as
a <i>function</i>  while the  others are  its <i>arguments</i>.  Thus:
</p>


<pre><code>
     (+ 3 4)
</code></pre>


<p>
is an expression, whose function is <tt>'+'</tt>
and whose arguments are <tt>3</tt> and <tt>4</tt>.
</p>



<p>
When Scheme evaluates an  expression of this form,  it evaluates the  function
and arguments, and then <i>applies</i>
the function to the arguments. Evaluating  the
above expression we get
</p>


<ul><code>
     7
</code></ul>

Likewise:

<ul><code>
    (- 5 4)
</code></ul>


<p>
means "the result of subtracting 4 from 5", or in ordinary mathematical
notation <i>5-4</i>.
</p>



<p>
A more complicated example is:
</p>


<ul><code>
(+ 3 (* 4 5))
</code></ul>

<p>
Here we evaluate <tt>(* 4 5)</tt> to get <tt>20</tt>,
and then add <tt>3</tt> to get <tt>23</tt>.
</p>


<h2><a name = "functions">So what are functions in Scheme?</a></h2>




<p>
Well, actually functions are <i>pieces of machine code</i> (in
effect subroutines for
those who have taken CMPSCI 201). So the value of the variable '+' is a  piece
of code for doing addition.
</p>



<p>
[Note you  can  actually  redefine  Scheme standard  functions.  This  is  NOT
recommended for novices, for you may lose important capabilities]
</p>


<h2><a name = "lambda">Making your very own function</a></h2>


<p>
A Scheme function is specified by the syntax
</p>


<ul><pre>
    (lambda <b> formals</b> <b> body</b>)
</pre></ul>

<p>
here <b>formals</b>
is (usually) a  sequence of variables enclosed in  parentheses,
and <b>body</b>
is  a sequence of  expressions. For the  <i>functional</i>
use of  Scheme,
only one expression is needed in the body.
</p>



<p>
Note that this is <i>not</i>
an application of the function <tt>lambda</tt>, but is what  is
called a "special form" in Scheme.
</p>

<p>
For example
</p>


<ul><code>
    (lambda (x) (* x x))
</code></ul>


<p>
is the function which squares its argument. So
</p>



<ul><code>
    ( (lambda (x) (* x x))  3)
</code></ul>

<p>
evaluates to  9.
</p>

<p>  The rule  for evaluation  of  a lambda-function  applied  to
  arguments is  to (a)  evaluate all  the arguments,  and  (b)
  strip off the  'lambda' and  substitute the  values of  each
  argument for  the corresponding  formals, (c)  evaluate  the
  body of the lambda with the values substituted. </p>

  
<pre><code>
   ( (lambda (x) (* x x)) (+ 3 4))
</code></pre>

<p>
Evaluate the argument
</p>


<ul><code>
   ( (lambda (x) (* x x)) 7)
</code></ul>


<p>
Strip and substitute for corresponding formals (x=7) :
</p>


<ul><code>
    (* 7 7)
</code></ul>

<p>
Evaluate body
</p>


<ul><code>
    49
</code></ul>


<p>
This may seem a funny way of defining functions - in Pascal we would give  the
corresponding function a name, like "square". In Scheme, this is easily done
</p>


<ul><code>
    (define square (lambda(x) (* x x))  )
</code></ul>


<p>
Scheme responds:
</p>


<ul><pre>
&lt;Compiled function: square&gt;
</pre></ul>


<p>
and now we can use it
</p>


<ul><pre>
    (square 4)
</pre></ul>


<p>
Scheme responds:
</p>


<ul><pre>
    16
</pre></ul>


<p>
An example of a lambda expression with more than one argument is
</p>


<ul><pre>
    (lambda (x y) (+ x (* 2 y))
</pre></ul>


<p>
And an example of its use is:
</p>


<ul><pre>
    ((lambda (x y) (+ x (* 2 y))) (+ 4 3) 5)
</pre></ul>

<p>
Evaluate the arguments
</p>


<ul><pre>
    ((lambda (x y) (+ x (* 2 y))) 7 5)
</pre></ul>


<p>
Strip and substitute, x=7, y=5:
</p>


<ul><pre>
     (+ 7 (* 2 5)))
</pre></ul>


<p>
and evaluate
</p>


<ul><pre>
     (+ 7 10)
</pre></ul>

<ul><pre>
     17
</pre></ul>

<h2><a name = "debugger">The Debugger</a></h2>

<p>
This is accessed by hitting the "Debugger" button on the Scheme Control Panel.
It is operated by a panel which contains the following buttons:
</p>



<dl>

<dt>Generate Debug Code:
<dd>This is  normally true,  so that  Scheme
generates code for  the debugger  by default.  Turn it  off to  create
smaller, faster programs.

<dt>Stop at  All Breakpoints:  <dd>This is  normally false.  When  set
true, Scheme will  stop after it  evaluates every compound  expression
such as (+ x 2).  It will print out "frames"  for the top n  functions
you are currently executing, where n is set by the "Number of  Frames"
slider.

<dt>Number  of   Frames:<dd>   This   slider   determines   how   many
function-frames you will see.


<dt>
Go To Next Breakpoint: <dd>Execution continues until the next
(automatically generated) breakpoint. Breakpoints occur after an
expression has been evaluated.


<dt>
Skip Current Function:
<dd> The execution of the current function will be completed without
stopping at any breakpoints.

<dt> Help:
<dd>Prints out help information about the debugger.

</dl>



<h2><a name  = "load">  The  function <tt>load</tt>  loads a  file  of
Scheme  code.  </a></h2>  <p>   The  function  application   <tt>(load

<h2><a name = "lambda_calc">The lambda calculus</a></h2>


<p>
This requires typographic  capabilities, so I  will put notes  on the  machine
separately.
