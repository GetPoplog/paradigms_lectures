                Beutiful Branching Proposal (Discussion 1)


Welcome to beautiful branching, purveyor of excellent searching
products based on efficient AVL trees.

Our products grow as you grow, without a tremendous loss of
speed - an amazing O(log n) search speed. Less sophisticated
hash tables get bogged down as they grow larger - with those,
as you grow, you get slow.

We also offer exctremely compact usage of disk space compared
to B-trees, which deliberately waste your precious resources.
In addition, B-trees are extremely hardware-specific - when
you upgrade, there is no guarantee that the disks will have the
same page size.

We will adapt our software to whatever OS or network server
you have.


Minimum Requirements (standalone machine):
    386 PC (or Macintosh)
    mono-chrome monitor
    25 MB free disk space*
     2 MB RAM**

Recommended (because we love fast machines):
    1 Gig free disk space
    128 MB RAM
    Pentium II running a network server
    LAN connection

We at Beautiful Branching look forward to telling you more
about our fast, efficient AVL products.

Sincerely,

**(no need to store ALL data in RAM, merely keys)

* a single letter is roughly 1 BYTE
  a record may be more than name and phone
    => a record is at most 200 bytes ~ .2 K
    => 100,000 records at .2K = 20,000 K
    => 20,000 K ~ 20 Megs

 This makes sense if you think about the little hand-held
 phone number units that have only 128K memory but store
 pages of names and addresses all the same.
