<h2>1  What is Object Orientation? </h2></a>

<p>
It is fairly easy to say what the functional and logic paradigms are about:
<ul>
<li>
     The functional paradigm takes as its theoretical basis the
     lambda calculus.
<li>
     The logic paradigm takes as its theoretical basis the predicate
     calculus.
</ul>
<p>
It is somewhat harder to characterise the imperative paradigm.

<ul>
<li>
     The imperative paradigm supports explicit local state changes and so
     reflects more closely the actual architecture of computers.
     (while the pure functional paradigm for example provides only state
      change to the global environment - you may define another function
      for example).
</ul>

<p> The object oriented paradigm is  about (a) creating "objects" in  which
behaviour is associated with data and  (b) ways in which these objects  can
be placed in a hierarchy in  which one kind of object can  <em>inherit</em>
the behaviour of others and (c) ways in which the structure of objects  can
be <em>encapsulated</em> so  as to  allow only legitimate  enquiries to  be
made about them.

<p>
Now (a) and (c) are both properties of <em>closures</em>
- a closure is an  association
of behaviour (i.e. some  code) with data,  and the data  can only be  accessed
only by passing appropriate arguments to the closure. So it is not  surprising
that we  will  use  closures  to represent  objects  in  our  illustration  of
object-orientation.

<p>
We often speak of the piece of code that implements a particular  behaviour
for a  class of  objects as  a  <em>method</em>. We  have already  met  the
concept of  method when  we  were implementing  the  special forms  of  the
<tt>eval_env</tt> and <tt>eval_eager</tt>  functions. So,  we could  regard
that evaluator as running  partly on object-oriented  lines. In that  view,
all Scheme expressions with a given  special form form a class sharing  the
same <em>evaluation method</em>.

<p>
For example, the  <tt>if</tt>
special form  has the evaluation  method <tt>method_if</tt>.  Thus
when we evaluate:
<pre>
    (eval_env '(if (= x 2) 3 4) the-global-environment)
</pre>
<p>
then <tt>method_if</tt>  is  called  actually to  perform  the  evaluation,
<em>via</em> the method-lookup in <tt>alist_method</tt>.

<p>
In general the essential aspect of  object orientation is that a named  action
applied to an object is mapped on to a piece of code for effecting that action
by means of a flexible mapping which  takes into account both the name of  the
action and the class of object to which it is applied.

<p> When we did  the Scheme expression evaluator  we mapped from object  to
action by means of an  explicit association list <em>alist_method</em>.  In
an object oriented <em>language</em> such  as Smalltalk, C++ or Java,  this
mapping is done in a way that is  <em>opaque</em> to the user - that is  it
is hidden in the implementation.

<a name = "sub_paradigm"></a>
<h2>
2  The sub-paradigms in object-orientation </h2>


<p>
There are two sub-paradigms within object orientation:

<h3>2.1  The message-passing sub-paradigm</h3>

<p>
In this sub-paradigm an object  is "sent" a "message"  to cause it to  exhibit
behaviour. For example,  if we  were simulating  a university,  we might  have
person objects, each one of which could  be told to print himself or  herself.
This could be accomplished, with a Scheme implementation of this sub-paradigm,
by:
<pre>
      (send  person 'print)
</pre>
<p>
which might cause the output:
<pre>
     name: Frederika Forsythe
     age:  42
     sex:  female
</pre>
<p>
Likewise
<pre>
     (send person 'age)
</pre>
<p>
might return the result <tt>42</tt>.

<p>
Sometimes arguments are embodied in the message, for example
<pre>
       (send person 'location 234 456)
</pre>
<p>
might be  used  to  reposition  a  person  in  a  simulation  that  went  into
topographic detail.

<p>
The most  significant development  of this  paradigm was  associated with  the
Smalltalk language.

<p>
Within this  paradigm, a  general concept  of inheritance  corresponds to  the
possibility that one  class of  objects may share  some of  the attributes  of
another class. For example, in our university model we would have students who
are a kind of person and professors who are a kind of person. Students will be
able to handle all  the messages that  a person can handle  - they have  ages,
sexes, addresses etc.. However they also have attributes peculiar to students,
such as the courses that they  take. Moreover they may respond differently  to
standard messages.
<pre>

     (send student 'print)

     name: Jeremiah Jolt
     age:  23
     sex:  male
     course: CMPSCI 287, STATS 101
</pre>

<p>
and
<pre>
     (send student 'courses)  ==> '( (CMPSCI 287) (STATS 101))
</pre>
<p>
The "send a message" approach has some  virtues. It is a quite natural way  of
talking about a distributed system in  which the objects are not all  resident
on a single computer so that information  has to be transferred via some  kind
of communication link, for example a local area network.

<p> It also has some snags, not least among which is the fact that the nice
higher-order functions we have  written in this course  are not so  readily
applicable to this paradigm. For example if we wanted to convert a list  of
students into a list of lists of the courses they were taking we could  not
use <tt>map</tt> in quite such a simple way. In the functional paradigm, if
<tt>courses</tt> was a function mapping from students to their courses,  we
would write
<pre>
      (map courses students)
</pre>

<p>
whereas in the message-sending sub-paradigm we have to write:

      (map (lambda (s) (send s 'courses)) students)

<p>
Moreover the fact that a  message has to be addressed  to one object makes  it
tricky to implement  certain functions  which naturally  involve two  objects,
such as comparing them for equality.

<p>
One common term  for this  limitation is  that this  approach embodies <em>
single dispatch</em>, that is methods are  selected on the basis  of a
single object  (and are usually associated fairly directly with that
object).

<p>
One can regard the  C++ language as supporting  a single-dispatch approach  to
method invocation.

<h3>
2.2  The distributed-function-definition sub-paradigm </h3>

<p>
The Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) and the <tt>objectclass</tt>
library of the POP-11
language support a different sub-paradigm, one in which object orientation  is
effected by extending the  definition of functions in  an incremental way.  In
Scheme syntax, one would say:
<pre>
      (print person)
</pre>
<p>
and have the same information printed out
<pre>
     name: Frederika Forsythe
     age:  42
     sex:  female
</pre>
<p>
However, instead of the print function being defined in one place
<pre>
(define (print person)
    (print-basic-info person)
    (cond ((student? person) (print-student-info person))
        ((professor? person) (print-prof-info person))
        )
    )
</pre>
<p>
the definition of how to print a person is distributed among various method
definitions, using a new special form.

<h2>
3  An example using the POP-11 objectclass library.
</h2>

<p>
By way  of a  change we  will  consider the  <tt>objectclass</tt>
library  for  POP-11,
written by Steven Knight of  Hewlett Packard Laboratories, Bristol. POP-11  is
derived from POP-2 [Burstall & Popplestone 1968], and is in essence a form  of
LISP with  ALGOL-60 derived  syntax.  For example  the factorial  function  in
POP-11 is defined as:

<pre>
    define fact(n);
        if n=0 then 1 else n*fact(n-1)
        endif
    enddefine;
</pre>

<p>
To enter POP-11 from  Scheme, execute the function  call (pop11) in your  base
window. To get back, type "Scheme". There is no literate version of POP-11, so
you'd have  to comment  out the  English (with  the /*...*/  comment  brackets
familiar to C users.

<p>
In POP-11, to print an expression <b>expr</b> you do
<pre>
    <b>expr</b> =>
</pre>
<p>
For example
<pre>
    fact(5) =>
</pre>
<p>
will print out
<pre>
** 120
</pre>
<p>
Finally, to declare a new global variable, and give it a value, one uses
<tt>vars</tt> command, exemplified below:
<pre>
    vars x = fact(120);
</pre>
<p>
creates (if required)  a new variable <tt> x </tt> and
makes it have <tt> fact(120) </tt> as  its value.

<h3>3.1  Defining person records</h3>


<p>
To load the objectclass library we need to execute the POP-11 command:

lib objectclass;

<p>
This will take some tens of seconds, during which the message:

;;; Objectclass, version 5.02
;;; Loading source files.
;;; Done.

<p>
is printed out. We are now ready to define our basic <tt> person </tt>
class of objects. This is done with the following syntax:

<pre>
define :objectclass person
     name     = 'John Doe';
     age :int = 25;              ;;; The type-constraint is optional.
     sex      = 'male';
enddefine;
</pre>

<p> This has the effect that each member of the <tt> person</tt> class is a
record with three fields  for <tt>name, age</tt>  and <tt> sex</tt>.  These
fields are accessible with three functions <tt>name</tt>, <tt>age</tt>  and
<tt>sex</tt> which are  created (or extended)  by the  <tt>objectclass</tt>
declaration.


<p>
The declaration also creates two  functions (called newperson and  consperson)
for creating  person objects  and one  function (destperson)  for taking  them
apart.
<ul>
<li>
    The function call: newperson() creates object with the default fields
    specified in the class-definition above.
<li>
    The function call: consperson('Jane Roe', 34, 'female') creates a person
    record with name 'Jane Roe', age  34,  and sex 'female'.
</ul>
<p>
We don't need to consider the effect of the destperson function.

<p>
Thus, we can create a new person object, and bind the variable p1 to have
it as its value by:
<pre>
    vars p1 = newperson();
</pre>
<p>
and print out the new person, using a default print-method that is created
when the person objectclass is created:

<pre>
    p1=>
</pre>

<pre>
** <person name:John Doe age:25 sex:male>
</pre>


<ul>
<h3> Object orientation in an Imperative Framework </h3>

 Object oriented languages designed from an imperative perspective
 usually distinguish between <em>fields</em> which an object may have,  and
<em> methods </em>  which may  access these  fields. Fields  are very  like
fields in a conventional data-structure (records in Pascal, or structures
in C). POP-11's <tt>lib objectclass</tt> creates records which, internally
have these fields, but which are only accessible by methods created
specifically to access them.

 The terms "constructor" and "destructor" are used differently
in O-O languages with an imperative background. A constructor is
a user-definable method-like piece of code which typically specifies
how the fields of an object newly allocated by the memory allocator are to
be filled  in.  In  C++,  a  destructor is  a  method-like  piece  of  code
specifying how  to  de-allocate an  object.  The Java  language,  in  which
objects are normally garbage-collected, does not have destructors, although
it  provides  a  user-definable   </em>finalize</em>  method  for   objects
containing entities  (files,  windows) that  may  need specific  action  to
delete them.

</ul>



<h3>3.2  Defining a method to print a person object.</h3>


<p>
If we don't like  the way the  default print function  works, we can  define a
function print for a person by defining the method:
<pre>
define :method print(p:person);
     printf('name: %p \n',  cons(name(p),[]));
     printf('age: %p \n',   cons(age(p),[]));
     printf('sex: %p \n',   cons(sex(p),[]));
enddefine;
</pre>

<p>
Here printf is a system function  which loosely follows the convention of  the
printf function  of  the  C language,  that  is  to say,  the  first  argument
specifies a string with  "slots" %p which  will be filled  in by values  taken
from the list which is the second argument. The empty list is denoted by [] in
POP-11, and  cons  is a  POP-11  function  corresponding to  the  Scheme  cons
function.

<p>
Now if we say:
<pre>
    print(p1);
</pre>

<p>
we obtain the output:

<pre>
    name: John Doe
    age: 25
    sex: male
</pre>

<p>
We can create another person:

<pre>
    vars p2 = consperson('Frederika Forsythe',42,'female' );
</pre>

<p>
so that evaluating:

<pre>
    print(p2)
</pre>

produces the output:

<pre>
    name: Frederika Forsythe
    age: 42
    sex: female
</pre>

<h3>3.3  Creating student as a sub-class of person</h3>


We can now create students as a kind of person:

<pre>
    define :objectclass student isa person;
          classes = ['CMPSCI 287' 'MATH 183'];
    enddefine;
</pre>

Here the force of the  isa construct is to say  that the new student class  of
objects ________inherits all the  attributes of a  person (name, age  and sex) and  by
default inherits  the _______methods  that apply  to  a person.  To be  precise,  the
records that implement the student object have fields for name, age, sex, with
methods of those same names. However, a student object has a new attribute,
namely the classes attribute.

vars s1 = newstudent();

If we print s1 using the built-in generic printing function of POP-11, we  see
that students have  inherited the attributes  of people, but  have classes  as
well:

s1=>

** <student name:John Doe age:25 sex:male classes:[CMPSCI 287 MATH 183]>


however the print function which we wrote, with a method defined for the
person class, treats a student as a person, printing out just name, age and
sex:

    print(s1);

produces the output

    name: John Doe
    age: 25
    sex: male

We can give the student object-class its own printing method:
<pre>
    define:method print(s:student);
         printf('classes: %p \n',   cons(classes(s),[]));
    enddefine;
</pre>
However if we call this, we simply get the information about classes:
<pre>
    print(s1);
</pre>
gives:
<pre>
    classes: [CMPSCI 287 MATH 183]
</pre>

We could of course  print out the people-attributes  of a student, by  copying
our earlier  code  for printing  persons,  but more  conveniently  there  is a
special form defined in lib objectclass, namely call_next_method, which  will,
in this case, call the method for the person objectclass.

<pre>
define:method print(s:student);
     call_next_method(s);
     printf('classes: %p \n',   cons(classes(s),[]));
enddefine;
</pre>

Now we find that:
<pre>
    print(s1);
</pre>
will produce:
<pre>
    name: John Doe
    age: 25
    sex: male
    classes: [CMPSCI 287 MATH 183]
</pre>
How does  call_next_method work?  Well, the  isa construct  defines an  ______object
_________hierarchy in which the student class comes immediately below the person class.
The expression  call_next_method(s), knowing  that s  belongs to  the  student
class of objects, arranges for the method appropriate to the next higher class
in the hierarchy, that is the person class, to be called.

<h3>3.4  Multiple dispatch in lib objectclass</h3>

<p>
This approach supports multiple dispatch, that is to say one can qualify  some
or all arguments of a method  with class membership constraints. For  example,
one might define one person as being senior to another in terms of age:
<pre>
    define :method senior(p1:person, p2:person);
       age(p1) > age(p2)
    enddefine;
</pre>
Whereas one might define one student as being senior to another in terms of
the number of classes taken:
<pre>
    define :method senior(s1:student, s2:student);
       length(classes(s1)) > length(classes(s2))
    enddefine;
</pre>
What happens if we  try to compare  a student with  a non-student. The  system
searches the class-hierarchy to  find a method that  applies to both. In  this
case the definition of senior for two people is used.

Where a class-hierarchy has some complexity it is possible that more than  one
method may exist which is applicable to the arguments of a multiply-dispatched
method call. What is to  happen in this case?  In fact lib objectclass  uses a
simple lexicographical rule to make the choice. The Common Lisp Object  System
does this  by default,  although  this default  is user-modifiable.  The  Java
language, which does this kind of search at compile-time, insists on finding a
unique _________maximally ________specific method-descriptor [Gosling, Joy & Steele 1996].
