<!-- ============================================================= -->



We shall regard <em>computation</em> as taking place in a countably
infinite <em>universe</em> of <em>objects</em>. This universe is created from
a certain set of <em>base objects</em> by using a single function,
<em>Apply</em>.

The universe contains at least the following <em>base objects</em>


<ul>
<li>  There is a zero object 0.
<li>  There is an object 1.
<li>  There is a "null object", denoted by []
<li>  There is a "false object", denoted by false
<li>  There is a "true object", denoted by true.
</ul>

<h2>Types of Object</h2>

A type  T is a subset  T<=Universe.  In particular there are the following
<em>base types</em>


<ul>
<li> Boolean.   This consists of the two objects  true and false

<li> Null       This consists of the single object, [].

<li> Procedure  Procedures provide the way of building our infinite universe.
                If p is a procedure, and x is an object of the Universe, then
                Apply p x is another object.

<li> Exception  An exception is the result of a "failed" application of a
                procedure. If e is an exception, then, for any object x
                (Apply x e) is an exception, as is (Apply e x).

<li> Integer

<li> Ratio

<li> Float

<li> Pair

<li> Symbol

<li> CompoundTerm

<li> LambdaAbstraction

<li> Theorem

</ul>

The (non-base) type Rational = Integer \/  Ratio
The (non-base) type Number =  Rational \/ Float

<p>
These base-types are mutually exclusive - any object belongs to at most one
base-type.

<h2> The MayBe and CouldBe type constructors.</h2>
Let T <= Universe be a type of which false is not a member. Then MayBe(T)
denotes the type<br> T \/ {false}


<p>
Let T <= Universe be a type. Then CouldBe(T)
denotes the type T\/Exception.



<h2> Function Types </h2>

<p>


<h3>Definition</h3>

If D and R are types then D->R is the type

<pre>
    {p | p of Procedure & !d. d of D ==> (Apply p d) of R }
</pre>

<p>
Thus if p is a procedure, we say that p has the type D->R if p of D->R. It
should be noted that in general, <em>no unique type can be ascribed to a
procedure</em>.


<p>
Unfortunately, it is not practicable to insist that our functions run without
exception. Consider the problem with division. Division by zero raises an
exception. We might think that we could elaborate our type-system to avoid the
possibility of well-typed expressions raising an exception, but this can
rapidly be seen to be impossible -  consider the rational function:

<pre>
                 P[x]
    R[x]   =   --------
                 Q[x]
</pre>

<p>
to know whether R[x] will raise an exception, we have to know the zeros of the
polynomial Q[x], which is a-trivial problem (and indeed in a certain sense,
insoluble) problem. Even if we relaxed our requirement to "f(a) evaluates
without exception almost everywhere in A", we still have problems, since to
know that this statement is true of R[x] requires knowledge, if not of
the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, at least of the fact that a polynomial can
have at most n roots, which, if not exactly a profound theorem, is certainly
beyond the scope of knowledge that it is reasonable to expect a type-system to
possess.

<pre>
    /  : Rational->Rational->CouldBe(Rational)
</pre>

<p>
The following basic lemmas hold for function types.


<h3>Lemma (contravariance of domain)</h3>

<p>
If D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, R are types for which D<sub>1</sub><=D<sub>2</sub>, then  D<sub>2</sub>->R <= D<sub>1</sub>->R


<h4>Proof</h4>

<p>
Let p of D<sub>2</sub>->R. Then Apply(p d<sub>2</sub>) of R for all d<sub>2</sub> of D<sub>2</sub>. But D<sub>1</sub><=D<sub>2</sub>. Hence
for all d1 in D<sub>1</sub>, Apply(p,d1) of R. Hence result.


<h3>Lemma (covariance of range) </h3>


<p>
If D, R<sub>1</sub>,R<sub>2</sub> are types for which R<sub>1</sub><=R<sub>2</sub>, then D->R<sub>1</sub> <= D->R<sub>2</sub>

<h4>Proof</h4>

<p>
Let p of D->R<sub>1</sub>. Then Apply(p,d) of R<sub>1</sub> for all d of D. But R<sub>1</sub><=R<sub>2</sub>
Hence Apply(p,d) of R<sub>2</sub> for all d of D.


<p>
A consequence of the contravariance rule is that, for example, despite the
fact that  Integer<=Number, the type Integer->Integer is not contained
in the type Number->Number.   Thus the union

    (Integer->Integer) \/ (Number->Number)

<p>
is non-redundant.


<p>
A simple converse of these two lemmas is clearly not true of all domains.
for consider a domain without procedure objects. Then D->R is always the
empty-set, so that D<sub>1</sub>->R<sub>1</sub><=D<sub>2</sub>->R<sub>2</sub> is true for any domains and ranges whatever.
So, discussion of the converse of these lemmas will have to wait until we have
established how richly populated our Procedure type needs to be.





<h3>Lemma</h3>

Let p of D<sub>1</sub>->R<sub>1</sub>\/D<sub>2</sub>->R<sub>2</sub>...Dn->Rn. Let d in D<sub>1</sub>/\D<sub>2</sub>..Dn. Then (Apply p d) of
R<sub>1</sub>/\R<sub>2</sub>...Rn.

<h4>Proof</h4>

<p>
For all i of 1..n, d of Di. Now p of Di->Ri. Hence (Apply p d) of Ri for all
i of 1..n.

<p>
This lemma suggests how we can ascribe a type to a function-application, where
the function belongs to a type-union of the above kind.


<h3>Lemma</h3>

(D<sub>1</sub>\/D<sub>2</sub>) -> (R<sub>1</sub>/\R<sub>2</sub>) = (D<sub>1</sub>->R<sub>1</sub>)/\(D<sub>2</sub>->R<sub>2</sub>).


<p>
Let p of (D<sub>1</sub>\/D<sub>2</sub>) -> (R<sub>1</sub>/\R<sub>2</sub>). Then, for all d1 in D<sub>1</sub>, (Apply p d1) of
(R<sub>1</sub>/\R<sub>2</sub>), so (Apply p d1) of R<sub>1</sub>. Hence p of (D<sub>1</sub>->R<sub>1</sub>)
Likewise for all d<sub>2</sub> in D<sub>2</sub>, (Apply p d<sub>2</sub>) of R<sub>2</sub>. Hence p in (D<sub>1</sub>->R)/\(D<sub>2</sub>->R).


<p>
Conversely, let p of (D<sub>1</sub>->R<sub>1</sub>)/\(D<sub>2</sub>->R<sub>2</sub>).  Consider d in (D<sub>1</sub>\/D<sub>2</sub>).

<p>
If  d in D<sub>1</sub>, (Apply p d) of R<sub>1</sub>, since p of (D<sub>1</sub>->R<sub>1</sub>).
Likewise if  d in D<sub>2</sub>, (Apply p d<sub>2</sub>) of R<sub>2</sub>.
Hence p of (D<sub>1</sub>\/D<sub>2</sub>)->(R<sub>1</sub>/\R<sub>2</sub>).


<p>
Henceforward, we shall adopt the convention that juxtaposition denotes
application. Thus if p is a procedure object, and x is an object, then p x
denotes Apply(p,x).

<p>
We can now complete the definition of our universe.

<p>
There are 3 procedure objects  S K I, for which the following conditions hold:

<ul>
<li> (K c) x = c , for any objects c and x in Universe.
<li> (I x)  = x , for any object x in Universe.
<li> S f g x = (f x) (g x) for any f,g in Procedure, x in Universe
</ul>

<h2> Types of the Shonfinkel Combinators</h2>

<h4>Lemma</h4>

If T is a type, then I:T->T


<h4>Proof</h4>.

<p>
Let t in T. Then I t = t. Thus I in T->T.


<h4>Lemma</h4>

If T1 and T2 are types, then K in T1->T2->T1

<h4>Proof</h4>.

Let t1 in T1, consider (K t1). For all t2 in T2, (K t1) t2 = t1. Thus
(K t1) in T2->T1. Hence K in T1->(T2->T1)

<h4>Lemma</h4>

If T1, T2 and T3 are types, and f in T1->T2->T3, g in T1->T4, where T4<=T2,
then  S in (T1->T2) -> (T1->T4) -> T1 -> T3

<h4>Proof</h4>.

<p>
We have to show that if  f in T1->T2 then S f in (T1->T4)->T1->T3

<p>
Consider S f, and let g in T1->T4 - we have to show that S f g in T1 -> T3.

<p>
Consider S f g - and let x in T1 - we have to show that S f g x in T3.

<p>
But S f g x = (f x) (g x). Since X in T1, and f in T1->T2->T3, it follows that
(f x) in T2->T3. Likewise (g x) in T4. But T4<=T2, so that ((f x) (g x))
in T3. Hence (S f g x) in T3, hence (S f g) in T1->T3, hence S f in
(T1->T4)->T1->T3, hence S in (T1->T2)->(T1->T4)->T1->T3.


<h2> Terms and their Denotation </h2>

<p>
In this section we will show how we can characterise any computation as
<em>evaluating</em> an expression in the Universe. An expression can consist
of

<ul>
<li>
    a variable    v
<li>
    an abstraction  \v.e
<li>
    an application   (e1 e2)
</ul>

<p>
Now one question arises "what does a variable standing by itself mean?".
Generally, we think of variables as standing for something else. It is
reasonable therefore to require our expressions to contain only bound
variables.

<p>
First let us consider abstractions. We would like the abstraction

    \x.(+ x 3)

<p>
to "mean" the function "add 3". so that

    (\x.(+ x 3) 7)   ==> 10


<p>
Thus we get to understanding the meaning of the application
of a lambda-abstraction to arguments in terms of <em>substitution</em>.
However we shall adopt a different approach here, motivated by the fact that
the concept of a <em>variable</em> and its scope can be tricky to handle.

<p>
We define a denotation mapping from Universe->Universe as

    Den[(\v.v)]   =  I
    Den[(\v.u)]   =  (E `free variable`)
    Den[(\v.c)]   =  K c
    Den[(e1 e2)]  =  (S Den[e1] Den[e2])








<p>
Any object O in Universe can play the role of being a <em>term</em>.
Let us define a <em>denotation function</em> Den:Universe->Universe as
follows:

Den(\x.x) = I
Den(\x.c) = K c
Den(\x. e1 e2) = S (Den e1) (Den e2)





<h4>Lemma</h4>

If D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub> are types, and D<sub>1</sub> is a recognisable type, with recogniser
is_D1, then  D<sub>1</sub>->R<sub>1</sub> <= D<sub>2</sub>->R<sub>2</sub> ==> D<sub>2</sub><=D<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>1</sub><=R<sub>1</sub>.

<h4>Proof</h4>. Suppose D<sub>2</sub> is not included in D<sub>1</sub>. Then there is a d<sub>2</sub> in D<sub>2</sub>, d<sub>2</sub> not in
D<sub>1</sub>. Consider  f = \x. if (is_D1 x) instance(D<sub>1</sub>)






<h2>Environments and Evaluation.</h2>


<p>
An environment is a representation of a finite mapping from symbols to
objects.

<pre>
Eval (f a) e =
    Apply((Eval f e)  (Eval a e)


Eval (if x y z) e = if (Eval x e) then (Eval y e) else (Eval z e)

Eval c  = c

Eval (\x. t)  e  = (Closure x t e)

Eval (Closure x t e) = (Closure x t e)

Eval (quote t) e = t


Apply p x e                   = PrimApply p x
Apply (Closure x t1 e1) t2 e2 = Eval t1  e1[x|t2]

</pre>
