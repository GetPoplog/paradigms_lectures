Beautiful Branching - Sketchy Cucumber Division
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    It has come to our attention that  your growing company is in the  need
of an automated telephone directory. Our company, Beautiful Branching,  has
dedicated itself to the custom development of automated phone systems.
    Our research/estimates suggest that your company, Big Carrot,  requires
a search engine for up to 100,000 employees/customers. We propose, by using
anAVL tree, that minimum access time and minimum hardware will be required.
A serial processor, memory resident data structure, and fast hard disk  for
swap are all that is necessary.
    You will find  that our technique  will allow for  O(logn) costs to  be
most efficient on large searches. Some of the advantages to AVL are that no
items are more than  two nodes apart. An  AVL tree always remains  balanced
which makes searching through larger  trees most efficient. AVL trees  also
constantly  maintain  themselves  in  order,  which  requires  less  system
overhead.
    If  you  have  any  further  questions  about  our  innovative   search
algorithm,  please  do  not  hesitate  to  contact  our  division,  Sketchy
Cucumber. Thank you for your time and  we look forward to working with  you
in the future.

                    Sincerely,
                    Product Design and Sales Team
