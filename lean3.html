<h2><a name = "interact">
Remember - all expressions in this file can be evaluated
</a></h2>

You will find it worthwhile to read these notes on-line using UMASS  POP2000
as a browser because every POP2000 expression occurring on a line by  itself
can be run. You can then try changing it and seeing what happens. Do not be
afraid of playing with the machine - you cannot break it!


<h2><a name="special">Special Forms are not evaluated in the usual
way.</a></h2>

As we  have seen  the  standard way  to evaluate  a  POP2000 expression  is  to
evaluate the function and  arguments and then to  <em>apply</em>
the function to  the
arguments.

<p>
This rule does not hold for certain <i>special forms</i>.
Examples of special forms we have  seen so far are:</p>

<h3>Lambda Abstraction</h3>

An expression such as <code> \x. x*x </code> is an example of  the
<em>lambda abstraction</em> special form. We can think of this as having a
pattern described by:

<pre>
   \ <b>formals . body </b>
</pre>



You  can  think  of  this  as  evaluating  to  itself,  with  a  rule   for
<em>applying</em> it to arguments (strip off \ and <b>formals</b>
and substitute...)


In the Lambda Calculus, there is only ONE special form, namely lambda
abstraction.  Having  a  small  number  of  special  forms  is  mathematically
desirable, since the  number of  different cases to  consider in  mathematical
analysis is reduced. However, in creating a practical programming language,
certain other special forms are usually introduced.  Where possible, these
are made <em>exactly equivalent</em> to forms that can be expressed just
using the Lambda Calculus.


<h3><a name="define">Defining a variable</a></h3>
<pre>
   Definition <b>variable = expression</b> End;
</pre>

This special  form evaluates  the  <b>expression</b>
and  <e>binds</e>  the
variable to the resulting value.


<h3><a name = "if">
Conditional Expressions - the <tt>if</tt> construct.
</a></h3>

POP2000 provides <em> conditional expressions</em> in
which  a condition (an  expression
which can have a boolean  value) or conditions are  used to choose which  of a
number of other expressions is to be evaluated.

The simplest form of conditional in POP2000 is the special form:

<pre>
 if <b>condition</b> then <b>expr<sub>1</sub></b> else <b>expr<sub>2</sub></b> end if
</pre>

<p>  It  evaluates  <b>condition</b>.  If  <b>condition</b>  evaluates   to
<tt>true</tt> the result is obtained by evaluating <b>expr<sub>1</sub></b>.

If <b>condition</b>  evaluates to  <tt>false</tt> then  the result  of  the
<tt>if</tt> expression is obtained by evaluating <b>expr<sub>2</sub></b>.

<p>In POP2000 it is an error for the <b>condition</b> to evaluate to
anything other than <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt>.

<p>
[WHY does it have to be a special form? Could it NOT be a special form? ].



<h2><a name="BVF">Boolean valued functions</a></h2>

Functions which return a boolean value (<tt>true</tt>&#160;
or <tt> false</tt>&#160;) are often called
"<em>predicates</em>".

By convention,  predicates have  a  name which  begins with <tt>is_</tt>.
Certain common predicates like '&lt;' are exceptions to this rule.

<h2><a name="symbol">Symbols</a></h2>

<p> An isolated POP2000 identifier can be quoted, for example <tt>  'a</tt>.
As such, it  is called a  <em>symbol</em>, and is  a member of  one of  the
basic datatypes of POP2000. </p>

<pre>
  'CaT'
</pre>

is a symbol distinct from

<pre>
  'cat'
</pre>

<p>
This reflects the fact that in  POP2000 case is significant, as it is in C,
but not in Scheme or Pascal.
</p>

<h3>The form <b>expr</b>.<b>symbol</b> is an expression.</h3>

In POP2000 the construct

<pre>
    <b>expr</b>.<b>symbol</b>
</pre>

is an expression exactly equivalent to <tt><b>expr</b>
'<b>symbol</b>'</tt>.
Why
does the language support this minor syntactic variant? This was done to
provide syntactic continuity between POP2000 <em>classes</em>, which are
functions mapping from <em>symbols</em> to <em>values</em> and constructs
of other languages (Java, SML, Modula...) which play a similar role, though
with a more restricted semantics.




<h2><a name="types">POP2000 Types.</a></h2>

Objects which can exist in an  implementation of POP2000 belong to  exactly
one basic type. The built-in types are:

<pre>
    Boolean,Char,Null,Number,Pair,
    Procedure,String,Symbol,Vector,Composite,Theorem
</pre>

With each of these basic types there is associated a <em>class</em>. In
POP2000 a class is a <em>function</em> which provides a basic collection of
capabilities for recognising, creating and manipulating members of a type
or types.
Each type-name above has a corresponding class-variable which is bound to
a class-function which provides basic support for members of that type,
so that
<tt>Boolean</tt> is the class-function associated with the type Boolean.

To recognise whether a particular datum <tt>d</tt> belongs to a given type,
we have the following construct <tt><b>Class</b> . ? d</tt>

<pre>
    Boolean.? d       is d a boolean?
    Char.? d          is d a character?
    Composite.? d     is d a composite expression?
    Null.? d          is d null?
    Number.? d        is d a number?
    Pair.?  d         is d a pair?
    Procedure.? d     is d a procedure, that is a function object.
    String.? d        is d a string, e.g. `the fat cat`
    Symbol.? d        is d a symbol, e.g. 'x'
    Theorem.? d       is d a the member of type Theorem?
    Vector.? d        is d a vector of values, e.g. {2,3,4}
</pre>

You will doubtless recall that the form <tt>Class.?</tt> is shorthand for
for <tt><b>Class</b> '?'</tt>.

<p>For any <b>Class</b>, the expression <tt><b>Class</b>.?</tt> is a
predicate for recognising members of that class.

<p> There is a convention in POP2000 that identifiers beginning
with an upper-case letter are the names of <em>classes</em> (a concept
related to type).

The predicates listed above, which
recognise members of the basic types of POP2000 which  do  <b>not</b>
overlap, that is for a given datum <tt>d</tt>, <tt><b>Class</b>.? d</tt>
will only evaluate to <tt>true</tt> for precisely one of the basic classes.

There may be others basic types, e.g. files, and, in some environments,
the <em>widgets</em>  or   <em>windows</em>   which  support   graphical
user interfaces.

<p>The POP2000 language system "knows" quite a lot about the types of data
that the built-in functions can operate on, and is able to detect certain
errors as  you compile code you have written. For example if you try to
compile</p>

<pre>
Definition funny =
    \x. x + (y>z)
End
</pre>

you will get an error message, because the system knows that <tt>y > z</tt>
is a boolean, and you can't do arithmetic on a boolean.

POP2000 has a limited built-in ability to
<em>infer</em> the types which a user-defined function can manipulate.

<h2>Subdivisions of the Number Type</h2>.

The type <tt>Number</tt> has a number (some pun intended..) of sub-types.

<pre>
    Int         Fixed precision integers, at least 30 bits of precision
    Integer     Arbitrary precision integers.
    Rational
    Float
    Double
    Complex
</pre>

If "<" means "set inclusion", then the following hold:
<pre>
    Int < Integer < Rational < Number
    Float  < Number
    Double < Number
    Complex < Number
</pre>

These inclusion relations are necessitated by closure requirements. The sum
of the rationals 1/2+1/2 is the integer 1, so the set of POP2000
<tt>Integers</tt> actually must be included in the POP2000 rationals. This
is not true of the <tt>Float</tt> type - the sum 0.5+0.5 is the
<tt>Float</tt> <tt>1.0</tt>, and not the integer <tt>1</tt>.

<h2> We shall not be concerned with vector and char</h2>.

In this class we shall not be concerned with the types <em>vector,
char</em>.

<h2><a name="arithmetic">Arithmetic in POP2000</a></h2>


Arithmetic operations are denoted by the  conventional  symbols:

<pre>
    +
    -
    *
    /
</pre>

There are also the usual  algebraic and trancendental functions. They  operate
on  integers,  rationals,  floating-point  representation  of  reals,  complex
numbers. Try:


<pre>
    sqrt -1;
</pre>

the answer is the complex number:

<pre>
    0.0+1.0i
</pre>

Comparisons between numbers are denoted by the conventional symbols.

<pre> &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=
</pre>

<h2><a name="factorial">The factorial function - an example of
recursion</a></h2>

The well known factorial function can be defined using the recurrence
relations:

<pre>
    0! = 1
    n! = n(n-1)!
</pre>

These translate into POP2000 as follows:

<pre>
Definition factorial =
    \n. if n=0 then 1 else n*factorial(n-1) end if
End;

factorial 5;

120
</pre>

Try evaluating
<tt>&#160; factorial 1000</tt>&#160;, and <tt>&#160;
factorial  1000 / factorial 999 </tt>.

<h2><a name="eager">POP2000 evaluates expressions in an Eager way.</a></h2>

The rule that POP2000 evaluates the arguments of an expression before  applying
the function is called <em>eager</em> evaluation, or
<em>call-by-value</em>.

Some functional  languages,  such  as  Haskell,  are  <em>lazy</em>,
and  evaluate  no
expression unless it is actually needed.

They have a better logical  structure (e.g. <tt>if&#160;</tt>&#160;
does not  need to be a  special
form in these languages), but are hard to make efficient.

<h2><a name="list">Lists are Compound Data.</a></h2>

So far we have seen that POP2000 has numbers, booleans and functions as objects
that a program can use.  These are simple data-types,  which we can regard  as
having no internal structure to be explored.

POP2000 provides a general-purpose compound data-type, the <tt>List</tt>.
A sequence of expressions, separated by commas, and enclosed in square
brackets is itself an expression, whose value is a <em>list</em>.

For example:

<pre>
    [1,2,3,4]
</pre>

is a list.

<h2><a name="nil">The empty list</a></h2>

The empty  list, denoted  by &#160;<tt>&#160; [] &#160;</tt>&#160;
has  no  elements  in it.  It is the only member of a  distinct
class, <tt>Null</tt>

The predicate:

<pre>
    Null.?
</pre>

recognises the empty list. It is an error to apply the functions
<tt>&#160; front</tt>&#160;
or  <tt>&#160;&#160; back</tt>&#160;&#160;
to the empty list.


<pre>
    front [];

This error report was prepared for Robin Popplestone
 by Jeremiah Jolt, your compile-time helper.

</pre>

<h2><a name="cons">Making Lists.</a></h2>

Quotation allows us to  make constant lists. However  we also want to  allow a
program to make lists that the programmer has not explicitly created. This  is
done with the function <tt>&#160; cons</tt>&#160;

<pre>
     cons x y
</pre>

makes a list whose <tt>&#160; front</tt>&#160;
is <tt>&#160; x</tt>&#160; and whose  <tt>&#160; back</tt>&#160; is <tt>&#160; y</tt>&#160;.
So to make a list  containing
just the number <tt>&#160; 23</tt>&#160; we do:


<pre>
   cons 23 []

    [23]
</pre>


Now let's define a function to make a "sandwich" list:


<pre>
Definition sandwich =
    \ x y. cons x (cons y (cons x []))
End;
</pre>

This could be written, equivalently but more conveniently, as

<pre>
Definition sandwich =
    \ x y. [x,y,x]
End;
</pre>


So:

<code>
    sandwich 1 2;
</code>

evaluates to:

<pre>
    [1, 2, 1]
</pre>


<h2><a name="identities">Two Identities which hold for POP2000
Lists</a></h2>


POP2000 is subject to the mathematical laws:

<pre>
    front (cons x y) = x
    back (cons x y) = y
</pre>



<h2>The Theorem Type</h2>
<p>We can't use the theorem type until we have a considerably more
sophisticated understanding of the language, but in essence a theorem is
a statement that is guaranteed to be true in a correctly implemented
POP2000 system.

<p>As an example, the theorem

<pre>
    |- All x y.  front (cons x y) = x
</pre>

follows immediately from the built-in axioms of POP2000.

<p>The only theorem-constructing functions available in POP2000 are
guaranteed
to create valid theorems. So, the predicate-call
<pre>
    Theorem.?  x
</pre>
is not asking if <tt>x</tt> is true - it's asking if <tt>x</tt> is a member
of the type <tt>Theorem</tt>. If it is it's guaranteed to be true - the
good news. The bad news is that the built-in functions for constructing
theorems only make very simple steps in proof. So that it is not easy or
automatic to make theorems of any profundity.

<hr>
<h2>A comparison with the SML and Java languages.</h2>

<p>The Class concept in POP2000 has some superficial syntactic  resemblence
to the Class concept of Java and the <em>structure</em> and <em> type </em>
concepts of  SML. It  differs  from both  these  language in  that  POP2000
classes are <em>first-class  objects</em>. In  Java a class  cannot be  the
value of a variable of  the language. Likewise in SML  a class can only  be
the value of a compile-time variable in a <tt>functor</tt>.

<p>The built-in type-inference of POP2000 is much more restricted than is
the Hindley-Milner type system  of SML. However, this deficiency is made up
for by the existence of theorems, which, following Milner, are a data-type
all of whose members are guaranteed to express facts valid in a
correctly-implemented POP2000 system.

<p>Our approach to theorem-proving is <em>not</em> foundational, since
there is a rich set of axioms which say, for example, that POP2000 contains
a correctly implemented representation of the integers. In this we differ
from the HOL system, which creates its theories from very the simple
foundation of the lambda-calculus itself.
